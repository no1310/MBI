Introduction
Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the world 
after cardiovascular disease.1 Approximately, 1.6 million 
cancers were diagnosed in the US in 2018, of which 271 000 
were breast cancers.2 Breast cancer has the highest mortal-
ity rate throughout the world.3 In Iran, breast cancer is on 
the top of malignancies diagnosed in females,4 with approx-
imately 33.21 cases per 100 000 population.5,6
Patients with breast cancer have numerous physical and 
psychological problems.7 Various factors such as fear of ill-
ness recurrence, body dysmorphic disorder, chemotherapy, 
surgery, young age, higher degree of illness, and lack of 
social support can lead to psychological responses in breast 
cancer patients.8,9 Psychological responses such as stress, 
depression, and anxiety are all associated with the disease 
diagnosis and treatment.10 Studies have shown the variable

Abstract
Introduction: Breast cancer is common among women and reduces their quality of life. The current study aimed to 
investigate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction group counseling in alleviating psychological responses 
such as anxiety, depression, stress, and regulating laboratory tests including cortisol and C-reactive protein (CRP) in 
women with breast cancer. Methods: This randomized clinical trial was conducted based on convenience sampling. 
Participants were divided into 2 groups (control and intervention groups) with block randomization. The intervention 
group received mindfulness-based stress reduction group counseling during 8 weeks. The participants completed the 
Beck anxiety inventory, Beck-II depression inventory, and perceived stress scale before and after the intervention and 
their blood samples were taken to check their cortisol and CRP. Results: After the intervention, the MBSR group had 
significantly lower anxiety compared with the control group (P &lt; .001). No significant difference was found between the 
2 groups in the reduction of perceived stress and depression (P &lt; .05). In addition, no significant difference was found 
between the 2 groups in CRP and cortisol levels after the intervention (P &gt; .05). Conclusion: The present study showed 
the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in improving anxiety rather than the stress, depression, and 
inflammatory laboratory factors such as cortisol and CRP in women with breast cancer. Therefore, the psychological 
symptoms of these patients can be improved at different stages of treatment by providing this type of training.

prevalence of depression (from 9% to 66%), stress (14.3%), 
anxiety (from 17.9% to 33%), and psychological disorders 
(from 15% to 60%) in women with breast cancer.11-14 
Psychological problems not only impair the patients’ 
immune systems, but also severely affect their quality of 
life.15,16 They also increase inflammatory responses.17 
Inflammatory factors such as cortisol and C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP) are associated with breast cancer progression18 
and psychological problems.19 Studies have shown that 
regulated inflammatory factors are important indicators, 
reduce morbidity, and prolong life expectancy.20
According to the American Cancer Society Guideline, 
one of the keys to survival in these patients is the evaluation 
and management of long-term physical and mental health 
conditions related to breast cancer and its complications.21 
Therefore, cognitive-behavioral interventions may be nec-
essary for these patients in addition to drug therapy,22,23 One 
of these is mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR).24,25 
Mindfulness focuses on the 3 elements of paying attention 
in the present moment, capacity to hold the object and non-
judgment.26,27 This attitude leads to awareness of negative 
thoughts and prevents mind rumination.28 Many clinical 
psychologists believe that MBSR induces neuronal changes 
in the gray matter and regulates emotions.29,30
Some previous studies showed the effectiveness of 
mindfulness in improving psychological status,31-33 regu-
lating cortisol level31,33 improving the immune system in 
breast cancer patients,34 and reducing CRP levels in 
healthy individuals.33,34 However, some other studies did 
not confirm the effectiveness of MBSR. Zhang et al 
showed the effectiveness of mindfulness intervention in 
the quality of life of breast cancer patients, but not in their 
sleep quality and pain.35 The results of a review study 
showed the effectiveness of mindfulness in lowering cor-
tisol, heart rate, blood pressure, and tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF), but had little effect on CRP.32 Therefore, the impact 
of mindfulness on inflammatory factors is still unclear. 
The psychological problems of patients with breast cancer 
may affect and impair other family members’ quality of 
life and function.36 A few Iranian studies have assessed the 
effectiveness of MBSR in psychological problems and 
inflammatory factors of the patients with breast cancer. 
Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the effec-
tiveness of mindfulness in psychological problems and 
inflammatory factors of breast cancer patients.
Method and Materials
Study Design and Setting
This study is a parallel-randomized clinical trial with allo-
cation ratio of 1:1. The research settings were the medical 
offices of oncologists and medical centers affiliated to the 
Medical Science Universities of Kerman, southeast Iran. 
The intervention was performed in Bahonar Hospital. The 
study lasted from August 2017 to November 2019.
Sample Size and Sampling
The sample size was 22 individuals for each group accord-
ing to a previous study (anxiety score: x1 = 47.53; S1 = 4.18 
and x2 = 43.06; S2 = 4.39),33 the confidence coefficient of 
95% and the test power of 90%.
Inclusion criteria were diagnosed disease between 
3 months and 5 years, no use of psychological treatment 
before and during the intervention, no drug addiction, no 
acute psychiatric disorders (psychosis, severe mood disor-
der, etc.), no mental disorders,37 no use of anxiolytic and 
antidepressant medications, undergoing at least 1 chemo-
therapy period or surgery, ages between 18 and 70 years,37 
breast cancer without metastasis,38 and no use of corticoste-
roids, psychoactive and hormonal drugs. Exclusion criteria 
were being absent in more than 3 sessions of MBSR, physi-
cal disability due to illnesses and treatments, use of cortico-
steroids, psychoactive and hormonal drugs,38 suffering from 
a major crisis during or about 3 months before intervention 
such as death of loved ones, comorbidity with autoimmune 
diseases, previous involvement in mindfulness groups,37 or 
endocrine diseases such as Cushing’s disease.39
All eligible patients were included in the study using con-
venience sampling. Of 57 eligible participants (17 patients 
from Yas center, 10 from the Jawad-al-Aemah Clinic, and 30 
from the oncologist’s office), 6 patients refused participation 
in the study. Finally, 44 patients completed the study (22 
participants per group; Figure 1).
Samples were divided into 2 groups (routine care and 
mindfulness-based stress reduction group therapy) using 
block randomization. Labels of A, or B (A = MBSR and 
B = routine care) were assigned to each group, and the block 
size was considered 4. Then the randomization list was gen-
erated by free online software (https://www.sealedenvelope.
com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists). The fourth researcher 
generated the random allocation sequence, and the first 
researcher enrolled and assigned participants to the groups.
Measurements
Demographic characteristics questionnaire, Beck depres-
sion inventory, Beck anxiety inventory, perceived stress 
scale, and laboratory test form were used in this study.
Demographic Characteristics
Demographic characteristics questionnaire includes age, 
sex, education, occupation, monthly income, type of insur-
ance, disease duration, type of treatment, type of surgery, 
lymph node surgery, duration of chemotherapy, history of 
specific disease, and use of specific chemotherapy drugs.</paragraph></page><page number="3"><paragraph>Mirmahmoodi et al

Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)
Beck et al designed the anxiety inventory in 1988.40 The 
inventory specifically measures the severity of clinical anx-
iety symptoms. The BAI was scored on a scale value of 0 
(not at all) to 3 (severely). The scores totally range from 0 
to 63 (scores ranging from 0 to 7 would be considered mini-
mal anxiety, scores ranging from 8 to 15 would be consid-
ered mild anxiety, scores ranging from 16 to 25 would be 
considered moderate anxiety, and scores ranging from 26 to 
63 would be considered severe anxiety).40,41 The validity 
and reliability of the scale have been confirmed in Iran.41
Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)
Beck et al developed the depression inventory in 1971.42 
This questionnaire is the new version of a 21-item self-
report questionnaire for measuring depression severity in 
adults and adolescents over 13 years old. The items of this 
questionnaire measure the physical, behavioral, and cogni-
tive symptoms of depression. The instrument was scored on 
the scale value of 0 (no specific sign) to 3 (severe signs). 
The scores totally range from 0 to 63. The cut-off point of 
this test is 13, meaning that scores ranging from 0 to 3 
would be considered healthy, scores ranging from 14 to 19 
Figure 1. The flow diagram of the study.</paragraph></page><page number="4"><paragraph>4 
Integrative Cancer Therapies 
would be considered mild depression, scores ranging from 
20 to 28 would be considered moderate depression, and 
scores ranging from 29 to 63 would be considered severe 
depression. The validity and reliability of the scale have 
been confirmed in Iran.43
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)
Cohen et al developed the perceived stress scale.44 The 
scale was scored based on a 5-point Likert scale (never = 0, 
almost never = 1, sometimes = 2, often = 3, and most of the 
time = 4). Phrases 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 13 were scored 
inversely. Therefore, for the 14-item scale used in this study, 
the scores range from 0 to 56 with the higher score indicat-
ing more perceived stress. The validity and reliability of the 
scale have been confirmed in Iran.45
Laboratory Tests
To assess laboratory data including cortisol and CRP levels, 
the researcher took 4 cc brachial vein blood samples at 8 am. 
Fasting was not necessary for these tests. All tests were sent 
to the laboratory of Afzalipour hospital in Kerman. Only 1 
person had to do the laboratory tests with the same device. 
The normal cortisol level in the morning is 7 to 28 μg/dL.46 
The normal CRP level is also 0 to 10 mg/L.39
Data Collection and Intervention
At the beginning of the study, the patients completed demo-
graphic information, depression, anxiety, and perceived stress 
questionnaires and then, the researcher took 4 cc brachial vein 
blood samples to check laboratory tests for both groups. The 
intervention and control groups simultaneously recompleted 
the questionnaires and tests after the last session.
Samples in the control group received the routine care, 
which included consulting with the psychiatric nurses, 
and psychologists if requested. In addition, additional 
information for referral to psychologist offices and cen-
ters were provided to each participant.
Samples in the intervention group were divided into 2 
groups of 12 to 14. They received the mindfulness-based 
stress reduction intervention in 90-minute sessions for 
8 weeks (1 session a week; Box 1).
One of the researchers (AA) skillful in MBSR prepared 
the intervention package. She trained the first researcher 
during 6 months, who in return trained participants in the 
intervention group.
Statistical Analysis
SPSS 18 was used in the study. Chi-square and Fisher’s 
exact tests were used to compare demographic characteris-
tics between the 2 groups. Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney 
tests were used to compare the mean stress scores in and 
between groups, respectively. Wilcoxon and independent 
t-tests were used to compare the mean scores of depression 
and anxiety in and between groups, respectively. 
Independent t-test and paired t-test were used to compare 
the mean laboratory data in and between the groups. 
ANCOVA test was also used to consider the confounding 
effect of variables. Significance level was considered 0.05.
Ethical Consideration
The Ethics Committee of Kerman University of Medical 
Sciences approved the present study (Code of Ethics: IR.KMU.
REC.1396.2291). The protocol of the study was registered in 
the Iran clinical trial registration system (Clinical trial registra-
tion number: IRCT20180113038333N1). Informed consent 
Box 1. The Intervention Protocol. 
Session 1: The study purpose and a summary of sessions were explained. Participants were then asked to eat a dried grape 
with full sensation, and practiced body scan meditation for 30 minutes (while drawing their attention to a part of their body).
Session 2: Participants discussed the practice of body scan meditation at home, the obstacles (such as restlessness and mind 
wandering), the solutions (non-judgment and abandoning intrusive thoughts), and the difference between thoughts and feelings. 
The participants practiced meditation in a sitting position.
Session 3: Participants saw and listened in a non-judging manner for 2 minutes, practiced meditation and breathing in a sitting 
position with focus on the physical sensations.
Session 4: Participants focused on the body sounds and thoughts, discussed about stress responses, reaction to difficult 
situations, alternative attitudes and behaviors, and practiced mindful walking.
Session 5: The participants did meditation in a sitting position and presented the second series of mindful body movements 
and mountain meditation.
Session 6: Participants talked to each other about home practices. Then, the following theme was practiced: the content of 
thoughts is not often real. Thereafter, 4 types of meditation were practiced in 1 hour.
Session 7: 4D meditation and awareness about everything at the present moment were practiced. The main theme of this 
session was as follows: what is the best way to take care of myself? Then, participants identified pleasant and unpleasant events, 
and planned an enjoyable program.
Session 8: The participants used whatever they learned. They began with body scan meditation and discussed about the 
obstacles of meditation.</paragraph></page><page number="5"><paragraph>Mirmahmoodi et al

was obtained from the participants. Samples were explained 
about the purpose of the study and were assured that their 
information would be kept confidential.
Results
The mean ages of the patients in the control and interven-
tion groups were 45.64 and 44.14, respectively. Table 1 
shows no significant difference between the 2 groups in the 
demographic and clinical characteristics except for the 
type of treatment.
The mean scores of anxiety in the control group were 
25.41 and 35 before and after the study, respectively. In 
other words, anxiety increased in the control group over 
time. The mean score of anxiety in the intervention group 
decreased from 31.18 to 23.50 after the intervention. Mean 
anxiety score was significantly different after the interven-
tion (Table 2). ANCOVA test was used to control the con-
founding effect of treatment type indicating a significant 
anxiety score between the intervention and control groups 
after the intervention (P = .01, mean difference = −10.88).
The mean depression scores in the control group were 
21.04 and 21.59 before and after the study, respectively. 
The mean depression score in the intervention group 
decreased from 29 to 17.18 after the intervention. Since the 
pre-intervention score was different between the 2 groups,

the pre- and post-test score difference was calculated. The 
results showed a significant difference between the 2 groups 
(Table 2). ANCOVA test was performed to control the 
effects of pre-test score and the type of treatment indicating 
no significant difference in the depression score between 
the 2 groups after the intervention (P = .15).
The mean scores of perceived stress in the control group 
were 28.64 and 28.04 before and after intervention, respec-
tively. The mean score of perceived stress in the interven-
tion group decreased from 33.68 to 28.09 after the 
intervention. The perceived stress of the intervention group 
was significantly higher than that of the control group 
before the intervention, but this difference was not signifi-
cant after the intervention (Table 2). Considering the con-
founding effect of treatment type and perceived stress score 
before the study, ANCOVA test showed no significant dif-
ference in perceived stress score after intervention (P = .14).
The mean CRP levels of the control group were 
12.09 mg/dL and 11.50 mg/dL before and after the study, 
respectively. The mean CRP levels in the intervention 
group were 15.50 mg/dL and 14.32 mg/dL before and 
after the intervention, respectively. The mean CRP was 
not significantly different between the 2 groups before 
and after the intervention (Table 3). Considering the con-
founding effect of treatment, ANCOVA test showed no 
significant difference in the CRP score between the inter-
vention and control groups after intervention (P = .61, 
mean difference = 1.15).
The mean cortisol levels of the control group were 
16.45 μg/dL and 16.68 μg/dL before and after the study, 
respectively. The mean cortisol levels in the intervention 
group were 18.77 μg/dL and 18.27 μg/dL before and after the 
intervention, respectively. The mean cortisol level was not 
significantly different between the 2 groups before and after 
the intervention (Table 3). Considering the confounding 
effect of treatment, the ANCOVA test showed no significant 
difference in the mean cortisol level between the interven-
tion and control groups after intervention (P = .08, mean dif-
ference = 2.31). In addition, the participants reported no 
adverse effect during the study.

Discussion
The results showed the effectiveness of MBSR in improving 
anxiety of the patients with breast cancer. Although, MBSR 
clinically improved patients’ stress and depression, it was 
not statistically significant. Furthermore, MBSR had no sig-
nificant effect on the reduction of cortisol and CRP levels.
Many studies have supported the effect of mindfulness 
on psychological variables. The current study only showed 
the effect of mindfulness on anxiety. Zeinal et al15 have con-
firmed this result. Some studies showed the effectiveness of 
psychological interventions in the autonomic nervous sys-
tem and endocrine system leading to reduction of anxiety. 
Some articles such as that of Khoury et al showed ineffec-
tiveness of mindfulness in anxiety.47 Patients with breast 
cancer experience great anxiety, so they may follow mind-
fulness practices more. In addition, participants had severe 
anxiety at the beginning of the study. This may be a reason 
why the MBSR has been more effective in patients with 
breast cancer than healthy individuals.
The present study showed no significant effect of MBSR 
on depression. Khoury et al showed no significant effect of 
the MBSR method on depressed healthy subjects because 
of subjects’ bias in filling questionnaires, inadequate num-
ber of sessions, or improper quality of training.19 On the 
other hand, Johns et al examined the effectiveness of mind-
fulness-based stress reduction program in the US breast and 
colorectal cancer survivors. MBSR has been effective in 
reducing depression.48 Armani Kian et al also showed the 
effectiveness of mindfulness in emotional health, depres-
sion, and glucose control in patients with type-II diabetes 
mellitus.49 Different results may be due to self-report ques-
tionnaires, which might be completed by patients pessimis-
tically. Other possible causes may be the quantity and 
quality of interventions, different types of disease and their 
effects on patients’ general condition, different treatments 
or medications and their side effects on general condition, 
cultural differences, support, patients’ interest, and mindful-
ness practices at home. In addition, participants had moder-
ate depression at the beginning of the study showing that 
the MBSR was less effective in alleviating depression of the 
patients with breast cancer in the present study.
Mindfulness had no significant effect on stress in the 
current study. Nyklíček and Kuijpers in the Netherlands 
performed MBSR on men with distress symptoms and 
found no significant difference between the 2 groups.50 
However, Zhang et al in China studied the effectiveness of 
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program (MBSR) in 
post-traumatic growth of the breast cancer survivors and 
showed a significant decrease in their stress 8 weeks after 
intervention.35 The ineffectiveness of MBSR in the present 
study may be due to the disease type, its psychological 
effects, and inadequate social support. Shaban et al reported 
that cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in Iran 
experienced several problems. The Iranian society has less 
addressed the patients’ quality of life and its associated fac-
tors.51 Different results may be due to different tools, type 
of illness, number and arrangement of educational sessions, 
cultural differences including family self-care communica-
tion, social, organizational, and governmental support, dif-
ferent health care costs in different countries or even 
different beliefs. According to Pourghane et al, stress cop-
ing strategies employed by people in stressful situations can 
be influenced by religious beliefs, culture, social support, 
and knowledge.52
Some studies supported the ineffectiveness of MBSR in 
inflammatory factors. Matchim et al showed ineffective-
ness of mindfulness in regulating laboratory tests (lympho-
cytes in cancer patients, melatonin, and cortisol), blood 
pressure, and heart rate.32 Moreover, Pascoe et al showed 
the effectiveness of mindfulness in decreasing cortisol 
level, heart rate, blood pressure, and TNF, but little effect on 
CRP.53 Some studies also confirmed the effect of mindful-
ness on inflammatory factors.31,32 Meyer et al showed the 
effectiveness of mindfulness in reducing CRP levels of the 
healthy individuals.34 These differences can be due to the 
number of intervention sessions, the number of samples, the 
amount of stress, support, the study population, and the type 
of drug therapy affecting the body and the immune system.
The psychological responses of people are intense after 
cancer diagnosis depending on the prognosis of the disease, 
the experiences of pain and suffering, and the costs of treat-
ment. Therefore, health care providers, particularly physicians 
and nurses, should support patients, their families, and psy-
chological interventions. It is recommended that psychologi-
cal techniques be considered for both patients and families. In 
addition to changing educational and counseling techniques, 
governmental organizations should support patients to reduce 
their stress and improve their quality of life.
The present study had some limitations. Many individual 
and family characteristics, and individual motivations 
might influence the study results, however the researcher 
has attempted to choose participants with the most similari-
ties. Since patients with cancer and their families were 
experiencing a stressful situation, several were reluctant to 
participate in the study. Many patients with breast cancer 
were unaware of their disease or treatment process, so the 
sampling process lasted nearly a year; this long period of 
study may influence the results. Finally, these results should 
be generalized to other populations with caution.
Conclusion
The results of the present study suggest the effectiveness of 
MBSR only in anxiety of the women with breast cancer, 
however the clinical effect of MBSR on stress and depres-
sion should not be ignored. MBSR also had no effect on 
inflammatory factors such as cortisol and CRP. Further</paragraph></page><page number="8"><paragraph>8 
Integrative Cancer Therapies 
studies are recommended to investigate the effect of MBSR 
on psychological responses and inflammatory factors of 
both patients with cancer and their spouses.
