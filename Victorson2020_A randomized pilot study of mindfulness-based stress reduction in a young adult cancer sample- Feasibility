Abstract
Background: The primary purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability 
of participation in a randomized waitlist-controlled intervention of mindfulness-based stress 
reduction (MBSR) in a young adult cancer sample. A secondary aim was to examine patterns of 
change in patient reported outcomes (PROs) of physical, social, and emotional functioning.
Methods: Participants were enrolled at a large Midwestern comprehensive cancer center and 
randomized to MBSR or a waitlist control. Feasibility and acceptability were examined through 
enrollment metrics and a survey. PROs were gathered at baseline, 8-weeks, and 16-weeks. 
Descriptive statistics and mixed models were used in analyses.
Results: Of 597 eligible participants, 151 (26.5%) consented from which 126 (83.4%) completed 
baseline measures. Sixty-seven participants were randomized to MBSR, and 59 to the waitlist. 
Immediately following MBSR, the majority of respondents (72%−78%) reported their experience 
with mindfulness was very logical and useful to increasing their wellbeing. Compared to waitlist 
members, MBSR participant’s scores on PROs improved in expected directions.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that recruitment for an intensive, in-person, multi-week 
supportive intervention can be challenging with young adults with cancer, similar to other cancer 
survivor populations; however once enrolled, feasibility and acceptability of MBSR was 
supported. Further, initial evidence on the role of MBSR on short-term changes in select PROs 
with this population was also demonstrated.

Each year up to 70 000 young adults in their 20’s and 30’s are diagnosed with cancer,1 many 
of whom are challenged with a host of negative short and long-term effects that can 
significantly impact their psychosocial wellbeing and functioning. As young adult cancer 
survivors make the transition from “cancer patient” to “cancer survivor,” psychosocial and 
physical challenges abound. A cancer diagnosis and its treatment can significantly derail the 
normative developmental milestones of young adulthood, often affecting educational and 
career aspirations, peer-group membership, formation of romantic relationships, changes in 
appearance, family planning and fertility, finances, and overall quality of life.2–5 It is well 
established that cancer survivors in general report late effects of treatment including fatigue, 
pain, fear of recurrence or secondary complications, and uncertainty about the future.6–8 
However, young adults may experience these sequelae at greater rates than other age 
cohorts.9–11 Given the psychosocial and physical complications young adult cancer 
survivors face, they may benefit from mind-body supportive interventions that promote 
wellness and coping skills across mental, social, and physical domains.4,5
Mind-body practices are defined as those that “focus on the interactions among the brain, 
mind, body, and behavior, with the intent to use the mind to affect physical functioning and 
promote health.”12 The use of mind-body practices has steadily increased in recent years, 
especially among younger adults.13 Based primarily on the instruction of mindfulness 
meditation and Hatha yoga, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)14 has become an 
empirically supported, gold standard mind-body approach for helping people reduce stress 
and manage disease and treatment related sequelae across multiple medical conditions.15–18 
MBSR facilitates the cultivation of mindful awareness through an 8-week program that uses 
an in-person group format to guide participants in the practice of mindfulness meditation 
and gentle Hatha yoga.19,20
Despite numerous randomized controlled trials of MBSR in cancer patient populations 
(predominantly in breast cancer) demonstrating significant improvements in emotional 
distress (depression, anxiety), pain, sleep, and health related quality of life,21,22 only a few 
small studies have examined the impact of mindfulness-based interventions in young adult 
cancer survivors. This includes a qualitative examination of the impact of Mindfulness-
Based Cognitive Therapy (n = 14),23 a single arm study of a mindfulness-based intervention 
for young adult cancer survivors (n = 16),24 and a single-arm study on the role of self-
compassion resulting from mindfulness training (n = 25).25 To date no randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted using MBSR with this population.
Given the sparse nature of this previous study, prior to conducting a full-fledged RCT to 
examine the potential health benefits of mindfulness-based interventions in this population, 
it is important to first determine several key components regarding feasibility and 
acceptability of recruitment, randomization, and retention; intervention delivery, outcomes 
assessment, and overall design.26 A smaller scale randomized pilot study of MBSR with this 
population would serve as a “dress rehearsal” to identify the readiness of a full RCT that is 
powered for efficacy and effectiveness. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to 
examine the feasibility and acceptability of participation in a randomized waitlist-controlled

initial patterns of change in PROs of physical, social and emotional functioning.
2 | METHODS
This study was made possible through research grant funding from the American Cancer 
Society, Illinois Division. All study procedures and materials were approved by the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the participating university. The trial was registered on 
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02495376).
2.1 | Recruitment and inclusion/exclusion criteria
Participants were recruited from medical clinics at a large, Midwestern NCI-designated 
comprehensive cancer center. IRB-approved study flyers were posted in approved locations 
throughout the hospital. The flyer included the study title, “Reducing Emotional Distress, 
Enhancing Function and Improving Network Engagement in Adolescent and Young Adult 
Oncology.” Initial scripted recruitment language included the following to describe the 
study’s purpose: “intended to reduce anxiety and improve the quality of life of adolescents 
and young adults diagnosed with cancer.” Not until participants were further along in the 
consenting process did they learn that this was a mediation and yoga study. A designated 
medical team member identified and referred potential study participants to speak with a 
trained research assistant, who described the study, answered questions, and conducted 
informed consent and HIPAA authorization. All participants signed an informed consent and 
HIPAA authorization form.
Inclusion criteria required participants’ current age and age of diagnosis (of any cancer type) 
to be between the ages of 18–39. They also had to be English-speaking, cognitively and 
emotionally capable of participating in an intensive, multi-week mindfulness course (as 
informally determined by referring medical staff), and able to use a touchscreen keypad and 
tablet device. Patients were also excluded if they reported high use of mindfulness 
meditation or yoga (eg, ≥3 times per week for the past 2 weeks).
2.2 | Procedures
Following enrollment, participants completed a baseline assessment of socio-demographic 
and clinical information and PRO measures. Then, participants were randomized to either 
the MBSR course (Mindfulness Group) or a waitlist control condition (Control Group) using 
a computer generated randomization procedure, following a 1:1 randomization schedule, of 
which the assignment was determined at the time of enrollment for each participant. PROs 
were assessed again at 8-weeks, and then again at 16 weeks following 8-additional weeks 
where some participants were randomized to receive a brief, weekly email message about 
mindfulness (this was a secondary aim of this study and is beyond the scope of these 
findings, however receipt of a weekly email was included as a covariate in all analyses). No 
financial compensation was provided.
2.2.1 | MBSR intervention—The MBSR intervention was delivered by qualified MBSR 
instructors who were trained on study-specific protocols, including the use of a standardized

conveniently located meeting rooms at the hospital and nearby community support centers 
that were large enough to accommodate meditation and yoga activities. Participants met 
weekly for approximately 2.5 h for 8 weeks and participated in a half-day retreat near the 
end of the intervention period. Sessions were video and audio recorded to ensure 
intervention fidelity among MBSR instructors across sessions. Additionally, instructors 
received regular supervision from the Principal Investigator and other co-investigators. 
Participants who missed a class were contacted by the instructor who provided them an 
overview of the session and home practice exercises. After course completion, Mindfulness 
Group participants were randomized to receive 8-weekly email messages about mindfulness 
(eg, “Notice what is happening in your body right now”) or receive no emails as a part of a 
follow-up exploratory study to examine longer-term maintenance gains from receiving 
weekly mindfulness messages. To control for this, we included whether or not Mindfulness 
Group participants received weekly mindfulness messages as a covariate in all analyses.
2.2.2 | Waitlist control—Participants on the waitlist completed all study assessments at 
baseline, 8-weeks, and 16-weeks. Following their time on the waitlist, participants received 
the full 8-week MBSR course. All participants received conventional supportive and medical 
care as defined by the clinic and physician serving those patients.
2.3 | Study measures
At baseline, participants completed questions about their previous meditation history using a 
detailed questionnaire developed by our group27 as well as the Expectancy/Credibility Scale,
28 which consists of items based on attitudes and perceived benefits of the therapy being 
offered. This scale is typically administered once prior to the intervention, however given the 
makeup of these items we administered and analyzed select items again at the 16-week 
follow up to determine post-intervention acceptability, using ratings of ≥7 (on a 1–9 scale) as 
indicative of acceptable. Items included: (a) How logical does the course on mindfulness 
offered to you seem?; (b) How successful do you think this course will be in raising the 
quality of your wellbeing?; and (c) How confident would you be in recommending this 
course to a friend who experiences similar problems?
Common indicators of Health-Related Quality of Life guided the selection of outcomes 
measures, which included the following three domains and measures below. All scales are 
scored/interpreted in the direction of the scale name (eg, a high score on perceived stress = 
higher stress). Score ranges are provided below for each measure, except for PROMIS 
measures administered via a computer adaptive test, in which case items were adaptively 
drawn from a full bank of calibrated items and are presented as T-Scores, with a mean of 50 
and SD of 10.

2.3.3 | Overall wellbeing—PROMIS CATS of Social Role Satisfaction, Emotional 
Support, and short form of Positive Affect and Wellbeing, score range = 9–45; Mindfulness 
Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS),32 score range = 15–90; Self-Kindness and Self-
Judgment subscales of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS),33 score ranges = 5–25 for each; 
and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory—Short Form (PTGI-SF), score range = 0–25.34
2.4 | Statistical analysis and hypotheses
All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25. Descriptive statistics were used to 
summarize indicators of feasibility and acceptability, which included the following criteria: 
(a) access to participants, (b) barriers to participation and clinical delivery of the 
intervention, (c) suitability of assessment procedures, outcome measures, time and resources 
required to conduct assessments, (d) willingness of participants to be randomized to 
proposed study arms, (e) instructor adherence to protocols, (f) acceptability to participants of 
the treatment, (g) participant adherence to treatment, (h) suitability of recruitment/screening 
processes, (i) participant retention among the allocation groups, and (j) whether intervention 
effects are consistent with expectations and previous literature. Based on our previous 
experience and organizational infrastructure delivering mindfulness interventions to other 
cancer survivor populations27 and recruiting young adult cancer survivors,35–37 we 
hypothesized that indicators related to access, recruitment/screening, outcomes assessment, 
and instructor fidelity would all be in the high range of feasibility. Further, we hypothesized 
that the intervention would be considered acceptable to ≥70% of attendees (as measured by 
the three previously described acceptability items); that no more than 2%−3% would attrite 
once randomized; that between 35% and 45% of those approached would enroll; and that we 
would not see greater than 10%−15% attrition once enrolled.
To evaluate the aforementioned last indicator, (j) whether intervention effects are consistent 
with expectations and previous literature, an intent to treat analysis was used. We 
hypothesized that compared to being on a waitlist, MBSR group participants would 
experience relatively greater increases in health related quality of life as evidenced by fewer 
symptoms of psychosocial distress (eg, symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, social 
isolation, fear of recurrence, and uncertainty intolerance), fewer disease and treatment-
related sequelae (eg, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain interference), and higher overall 
wellbeing (eg, social role satisfaction, emotional support, positive affect and wellbeing, 
mindfulness, self-compassion, and posttraumatic growth). Following bivariate analyses 
(using chi-square and independent samples t-tests) to examine potential group differences 
between intervention and control conditions and completers/non-completers, we tested for 
intervention effects on each outcome variable from baseline to 16-weeks. Longitudinal 
mixed models were specified using data from week 16 as the dependent variable. Each 
outcome was tested separately as the dependent variable; intervention arm, and time point 
were entered as fixed effects. All models were adjusted for meditation history, receipt of

feasibilty and acceptabilty outcomes, a power analysis was premature for this phase.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Enrollment and attrition
In total, 597 eligible participants were identified, of which 151 (26.5%) consented and 126 
(83.4%) completed baseline measures. Sixty-seven participants were randomized to MBSR, 
and 59 to the waitlist. A marginally significant baseline difference in meditation history 
between intervention and control conditions was observed (P = .07); therefore meditation 
history was included as a covariate in subsequent analyses. Following randomization, 48 
individuals enrolled in an MBSR course. No statistically significant differences were 
observed between completers and non-completers. Additional information about enrollment 
and attrition, including details regarding reasons for dropout, are presented in Figure 1.
3.2 | Demographic and clinical characteristics
On average, participants were 32.8 years old (SD = 4.76). The majority of participants were 
female (78.6%), Caucasian (74.6%), employed full time (61.1%), and had completed at least 
a college degree (83.3%). Most participants were either married (43.7%) or single and had 
never been married (41.3%). Participants had been diagnosed on average 2.06 years prior to 
study enrollment. This breaks down to 48.4% being &lt;1 year since diagnosis; 18.6% being 1–
3 years post diagnosis; 11.2% being 4–5 years post diagnosis, and 6.4% being 6–10 years 
post diagnosis. The majority (58.9%) stated they had completed treatment (38.1% were still 
in treatment, 3% unsure), which included surgery (62.1%), radiation (41.9%), and 
chemotherapy (81.5%). Breast cancer and lymphoma were the most common cancer types 
(34.1% and 25.4%, respectively). 81.7% of the participants had never regularly engaged in a 
meditation practice (Tables 1 and 2).
3.3 | Feasibility and acceptability of the MBSR intervention
3.3.1 | Barriers to clinical delivery of the intervention—There were no major 
barriers to the clinical delivery of the intervention. From time to time an MBSR instructor 
would be ill or unavailable, however we had a substitute instructor pool in place to 
accommodate this. Identifying a suitable, large group room within the hospital was also 
sometimes challenging, however we partnered with a nearby community cancer support 
center to expand our room options.
3.3.2 | Willingness of participants to be randomized to proposed study arms
—Of the 126 individuals who were randomized to MBSR or a waitlist, three individuals 
reported dropping out due to dissatisfaction with their group assignment. Randomization 
was explained in the following way, “You will be randomly assigned to one of two groups 
(Group A or Group B). If assigned to Group A, you will begin the course at its earliest 
availability. If assigned to Group B, you will be placed on a waitlist for 16 weeks before 
beginning the course. Group B participants will partake in the study procedures in the same 
manner as Group A.”

participating, the vast majority reported it was due to distance (41.5%) or time constraints 
(21.7%). Relatively smaller groups reported it was due to a lack of interest in research 
(6.1%), scheduling challenges (5.6%), health issues (5.2%), or a lack of interest in MBSR 
(4.9%). Some reported having transportation issues (1.8%) or feeling too overwhelmed by 
current stressors (1.3%). The remaining group passively refused and gave no information 
(11.9%).
A subset of individuals who declined (n = 120–126) were asked if they would participate in 
an MBSR course if it were offered in an alternative locations or formats. Of those asked, 
73.8% stated they would enroll in MBSR if it were offered at a location closer to home, and 
70.8% stated they would enroll in an online MBSR course. Eighty-six (n = 86) of the 
individuals who indicated interest in an online MBSR course were queried about specific 
online course formats: 68.6% stated they would enroll in a live/synchronous video-
conference-delivered course taught by an instructor, 70.9% stated they would enroll in a self-
directed “educational modules” course, and 73.3% stated they would enroll in a “hybrid” 
course that contained both synchronous experiences in addition to self-directed educational 
content. Following randomization to MBSR, 48 individuals of the 68 who were randomized 
actually enrolled in an MBSR course. Of the 19 individuals who dropped out between 
consent and the start of a course, the most common reason was scheduling conflict.
3.3.4 | Participant adherence to treatment/retention among the allocation 
groups—Of those who enrolled in MBSR, 75% (n = 36) completed the course and the 8-
week assessment. This is consistent with previous studies, in which the average MBSR drop-
out rate among cancer patients was 23% (13). Fifty-four percent (54%) attended between 6–
8 sessions. Similarly 54% attended the half-day retreat. Of the eight possible sessions (2.5 h 
per session X 8 = 20 h) and half-day retreat (4 h), MBSR attendance ranged from 2.5 to 24 h 
among individuals who participated in the course. The median MBSR attendance was 18 h, 
while the average was 15 h. Reasons for drop-out included passive withdrawal (not 
responding to calls/emails) [25.0%], time constraints (25.0%), and health concerns (feeling 
too ill to continue) [16.7%]. Individuals randomized to the Mindfulness Group who found 
MBSR to be less credible at baseline were less likely to complete all study procedures, t(66) 
= −2.40; P = .019. Similarly, those who expected MBSR to be less effective were also less 
likely to complete all study procedures t(65) = −2.31; P = .024. See Table 3 for means and 
standard deviations on outcomes measures across different time points.
3.3.5 | Acceptability to participants of the treatment—Following course 
participation, the majority of participants reported their experience with mindfulness to be 
very logical (77.6%) and one that would be very useful in raising the quality of their 
wellbeing (72.4%). Similarly, the majority stated they would recommend this course to a 
friend with similar problems (71.1%). These reports at 16 weeks were relatively consistent 
with, and in some cases higher than ratings provided at baseline (75.4%, 73%, and 62.4%, 
respectively), suggesting exposure to the MBSR intervention was an overall satisfactory 
experience.

previous literature—Compared to waitlist participants, MBSR participants reported 
significantly greater increases in self-kindness (a sub-domain of self-compassion) over time 
F(2, 79.48) = 3.64, P = .031, Cohen’s d = 0.44. No other interaction effects were statistically 
significant. Within group changes on outcomes from baseline to each follow-up were 
examined among control and treatment conditions. The control condition demonstrated 
statistically significant changes in perceived stress, F (2, 86.84) = 3.51, P = .034, Cohen’s d 
= 0.26 and intolerance of uncertainty, F(2, 86.18) = 4.64, P = .012, Cohen’s d = 0.42 
Pairwise comparisons revealed statistically significant decreases in perceived stress from 
baseline to 8 weeks (P = .012) and from 8 to 16 weeks (P = .035), as well as decreases in 
uncertainty intolerance from 8 to 16 weeks (P = .006).
Individuals in the MBSR group reported statistically significant within group improvements 
in all three domains of disease and treatment related symptoms, psychosocial distress, and 
overall wellbeing. A statistically significant improvement from baseline was observed on 
sleep, F(2, 79.75) = 4.39, P = .016, Cohen’s d = 0.47, indicating sleep disturbance decreased 
from baseline to 8 weeks (P = .012) and from 8 to 16 weeks (P = .010). MBSR participants 
also reported reduced intolerance of uncertainty F(2, 82.34) = 3.50, P = .035, Cohen’s d = 
0.51 with decreases from baseline to 8 weeks (P = .015) and 8 to 16 weeks (P = .006). 
Finally, improvements were also observed in post-traumatic growth, F(2, 82.95) = 3.41, P 
= .038, Cohen’s d = 0.41, and self-kindness, F(2, 77.67) = 7.35, P = .001, Cohen’s d = 0.46, 
with both increasing from week 8 to week 16 (P = .011 and P &lt; .001, respectively).
4 | DISCUSSION
Overall, our findings indicate that MBSR was an acceptable intervention for study 
participants who took part in the program. This may be attributed to MBSR, and/or that 
study completers were simply inclined to view their experience in a positive way. The 
current in-person format of MBSR does not seem to be very feasible for this population, 
however interest in an online version of MBSR was expressed by over 70% of those who 
declined.
MBSR is an intensive, in-person, multi-week, mind-body intervention. Participation requires 
an active commitment to attend as many sessions as possible, participate in daily home 
practice, and attend a half-day retreat. While our enrollment rate of 26.5% is on par with 
other MBSR interventions in oncology, suggesting similar challenges to in-person 
participation as other groups,22,38 this population may experience unique barriers, including: 
(a) participating in clinical research significantly less than other age groups; (b) harboring 
skepticism and mistrust toward researchers; and (c) holding attitudes that research is 
inaccessible, overwhelming, inconvenient, burdensome, and frustrating.39
Given the pilot nature of this effort, the present study was under-powered for efficacy 
outcomes. Therefore, the observed group difference in self-kindness or within group 
improvements in sleep disturbance, uncertainty intolerance and posttraumatic growth should 
not be used to infer efficacy, but rather as initial evidence that certain outcomes performed

passage of time or expectancy effects.
4.1 | Study limitations
In addition to the small sample size, this present study was limited by demographic 
homogeneity. Another limitation was the inclusion of participants who were at all stages of 
their cancer journey from active treatment to 10 years post diagnosis, some of whom may 
have been getting worse from treatment and others in the initial recovery stage immediately 
after treatment. This could have significantly influenced score variability and the likelihood 
of observing a change in PROs. Notwithstanding, it should be noted that the majority of 
PROs trended in expected directions, suggesting future studies be conducted that are 
powered for efficacy designed trials.
4.2 | Clinical implications
Findings from this study support further clinical mindfulness programs and research with 
this population. A majority of attendees reported finding it valuable for their wellbeing and 
would recommend it to a friend facing similar challenges. Considering this population’s 
struggles with loneliness and social isolation, their need for developmentally appropriate 
psychosocial support, and their status as “digital natives,”40 future clinical and research 
efforts should examine the effects of technology-enabled interventions. This would increase 
our understanding on how moving from an in-person group environment to an online 
environment might affect intervention delivery dynamics, social support, learning styles, and 
overall uptake.
5 | CONCLUSION
The present study was the first randomized-controlled pilot trial of an MBSR intervention 
with a young adult cancer sample. Overall, this program was feasible to deliver and 
acceptable to participants who experienced it, yet infeasible for the majority of those to 
whom it was offered, mostly due to limited time and distance. Given interest and feedback 
for an online format from those who declined, future iterations of this intervention should 
consider exploring the impact of online delivery.
