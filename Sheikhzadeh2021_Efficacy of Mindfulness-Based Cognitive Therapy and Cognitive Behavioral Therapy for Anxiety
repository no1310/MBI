Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety, Depression, and Fatigue in 
Cancer Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial

Abstract  
 
Objective: Cancer is associated with some psychological problems that play an important role in the severity and 
continuity of cancer. Cancer may lead to maladaptive psychological reactions such as anxiety, depression, and fatigue. 
Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in cancer patients. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of mindfulness-
based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety, depression, and fatigue in cancer 
patients. 
Method: The present study was a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Of the 100 patients diagnosed with cancer, 60 patients 
were eligible to participate in this study according to the inclusion / exclusion criteria. They were randomly assigned into 
3 groups: MBCT, CBT, and wait-list group (WLG). Afterward, the experimental groups received 8 weekly treatment 
sessions. All the participants fulfilled the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Cancer-
Related Fatigue Scale (CFS) before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS-16 software by Analysis 
of Covariance (ANCOVA).  
Results: The results indicated a significant reduction in depression, anxiety, and fatigue scores in CBT and MBCT 
groups. There was a significant difference between both treatment groups with WLG in the anxiety and depression, but 
no significant difference was found between MBCT and CBT groups. Additionally, there was only a significant difference 
between the CBT group and WLG in terms of fatigue (P = 0.01). 
Conclusion: CBT and MBCT performed equally well in decreasing anxiety and depression in cancer patients, and they 
were significantly better than WLG. It seems that MBCT is a good alternative to CBT for decreasing emotional symptoms 
in cancer patients. As a result, CBT and MBCT could be considered a good addition to pharmacological treatment of 
cancer patients with comorbid psychological symptoms. However, CBT was preferable to MBCT in decreasing fatigue. 
The study was registered at the irct.ir database under registration number IRCT20180503039509N1.

Cancer is a chronic illness that is the second reason of 
death in developed countries and the third cause of 
mortality in developing countries (1). According to the 
Global Cancer Observatory (GCO) statistics, it was 
reported 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million 
cancer-associated deaths around the world in 2012 (2). 
The GCO statistics in 2018 reported about 110 000 new 
cancer cases and about 56 000 patients died of it in Iran 
in 2018 (3). Furthermore, cancer is considered as the 
third cause of death in Iran. In this regard, the most 
common types of cancer among Iranians are breast, 
colorectal, bladder, stomach, and prostate cancers. In 
addition, breast and gastrointestinal cancers cause the 
highest mortality rates (4).  
Research has shown that the cancer is highly associated 
with some psychological problems (5). Anxiety and 
depression are the most common comorbidity of cancer 
(6). It has been stated that 60% of individuals with 
cancer 
have 
psychological 
symptoms 
(especially 
depression and anxiety) associated with cancer and 
according to the American Cancer Society, more than 
25% of patients with cancer suffer from clinical 
depression symptoms (7,8). Anxiety may increase 
feelings of pain and interfere with sleep and decrease the 
quality of life. Also, anxiety may even shorten the 
cancer patient's life (9). Cancer-associated fatigue is 
another common disabling symptom among individuals 
with cancer and a symptom that is experienced by 
majority of individuals with cancer (10). The prevalence 
of cancer-related fatigue has been reported from 59% to 
nearly 100% depending on the clinical status of the 
cancer (11). This type of fatigue is intensified during 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy and may also persist 
after the treatment period (12). It usually leads to 
irritability, inability to cope with the disease, withdrawal 
from social activities, and inability to do daily activities 
(13).  
Although there is evidence for the efficacy of 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating cancer, 
they do not necessarily improve patients’ psychological 
symptoms (14). Some patients may even leave 
chemotherapy due to their psychological symptoms (15).  
Psychological treatments have been shown to be 
effective in psychological symptoms; CBT as a 2-wave 
therapy is the most common psychological treatment for 
depression and anxiety (16). The usefulness of CBT in 
reducing fatigue has been also confirmed in several 
studies, and it has been reported that CBT is 
significantly more effective than usual care that included 
the treatment for cancer based on the guidelines of the 
comprehensive cancer center (17). In this respect, Cohen 
and Cotton investigated the efficacy of CBT in cancer 
patients and found diminished symptoms of anxiety and 
depression (18). Another study by Eichler et al indicated 
a 70% decline in fatigue, 33% for anxiety, and 57% for 
depression among breast cancer patients following the 
CBT (19). Despite the high degree of empirical support 
for CBT, recently third-wave therapies have been 
increasingly popular. 
There are several reasons for the development of third-
wave therapies. First, challenging patients’ dysfunctional 
thoughts through CBT not only fails to convince them 
that they are wrong but also it may aggravate their 
feelings of incompetence. Second, rational responses can 
often turn into obligatory statements like “must” and 
“should” that can increase pressures on patients. Third, 
because a rational response acts as a stream of hope for 
patients, these individuals lose their hope if it is not 
supported with evidence (20).  
MBCT is a third-wave treatment that is based on 
mindfulness (21), as a receptive and nonjudgmental 
awareness of the present moment (22). It consists of a 
combination of the main techniques of CBT and 
mindfulness (20). Mindfulness meditation activates the 
regions of the brain that are responsible for positive 
emotions and thus has a beneficial effect on immune 
functions of the body (23). This process allows 
individuals to make less painful sense of present-
moment events. When individuals become aware of the 
present moment, they do not focus on the past or the 
future. Instead, the majority of psychological disorders 
are created by focusing on the past (24). This treatment 
aims to improve patients by using the main techniques of 
both waves of therapy (21). MBCT and CBT have 
similar objectives and both of them intend to help 
individuals recognize the role of negative automatic 
thoughts in inducing depression symptoms (25). Unlike 
traditional cognitive therapy, putting emphasis on 
evaluating and changing the validity of thought content 
and composing alternative thoughts, MBCT encourages 
attention and awareness of thought and feeling as well as 
observes them as they come and go, so that the 
association between negative automatic thoughts and 
unhappy feelings is decreased (26). According to the 
results of a study in Japan, MBCT was well accepted via 
Japanese cancer sufferers and had a positive effect on 
their mental status and quality of life (27).  
The 
reason 
for 
examining 
the 
psychological 
interventions on cancer includes the high frequency of 
emotional difficulties comorbidities in cancer and it 
seems that the use of psychological therapies is 
necessary 
for 
them. 
Since 
there 
are 
various 
psychological therapies, it is necessary to be selected as 
the most effective one. Based on the authors’ 
knowledge, there was no study that compared the 
efficacy of MBCT and CBT for anxiety, fatigue, and 
depression in cancer patients. Therefore, the comparison 
of these treatments affects the emotional symptoms of 
cancer patients can help determine a more effective 
psychotherapy for them. Finally, the present study aimed 
to investigate whether the given treatments (MBCT and 
CBT) have different effects and to find which one has 
more efficacy in reducing anxiety, fatigue, and 
depression in cancer patients.</paragraph></page><page number="3"><paragraph>Efficacy of MBCT and CBT in Cancer Patients

Materials and Methods 
 
Design and Participants 
A parallel randomized clinical trial (RCT) with a pretest 
and a posttest was conducted on 3 groups (2 
experimental groups and a WLG). A total of 100 cancer 
patients who referred to Ghaem and Imam Reza 
hospitals in Mashhad, Iran, in 2018, were screened based 
on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were 
confirmed during an initial interview by the first author . 
 The below formula was used to determine the sample 
size: 
 
α = 0.05, β = 0.2, μ and σ were estimated according to 
the results of a previous study (28); therefor, μ1 = 35.7 
(mean score for fatigue after intervention), σ1 = 11.0, μ2 
= 43.4 (mean score for fatigue in the control group), σ2 
= 8.7 . 
Among the 100 cancer patients, 60 who met the 
inclusion criteria were selected by the purposive 
sampling method (Figure 1). Participants were randomly 
placed in the WLG and 2 experimental groups using a 
random number table. The inclusion criteria were as 
follows: age 18 to 50 years, at least a ninth-grade 
literacy level, diagnosis of cancer with minimum 
duration of 6 months, awareness of the diagnosis, no 
severe mental disorders (psychosis or bipolar disorder), 
no suicidal ideation, no physical illnesses except cancer 
(based on medical records and self-reports), ability to 
participate in therapy sessions (ability to sit for 90 
minutes and have enough time), and signing the 
informed consent form. Exclusion criteria were being 
absent in therapy sessions more than 2 times, receiving 
other psychotherapies, suicide thoughts, and drug abuse. 
The current study was approved by the ethics committee 
of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences with the 
number of Ir.mums.REC.1397.025. This study is 
registered at the irct.ir database under registration 
number IRCT20180503039509N1.

Measurements 
 
Primary Outcome Measures 
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)  
This inventory was comprised of 21 items based on a 4-
point scale from not at all to severely. In this inventory, 
each item described a common symptom of anxiety. The 
scores variety from 0 to 63 (29). A score &lt;8 shows no 
anxiety, scores 8 to 15 indicate mild anxiety, 16 until 25 
moderate anxiety, and higher than 26 indicate severe 
anxiety. The internal consistency coefficient of the BAI 
(Cronbach’s α) was reported at 0.92. Its test-retest 
reliability during one week was also by 0.75 with item-
total correlations (30). The Persian version of BAI</paragraph></page><page number="4"><paragraph>Sheikhzadeh, Zanjani, Baari 
 
 
Iranian J Psychiatry 16: 3, July 2021 ijps.tums.ac.ir
 
274 
indicated a great reliability (Cronbach’s Alpha= 0.92) 
and validity (31). BAI had good reliability in the current 
study (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.88).  
  
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)  
This 21-item inventory has been developed to assess the 
severity of depression. In this questionnaire, each item 
described a common symptom of depression. The items 
were also presented in the form of 4 alternative 
statements and the scores ranged from 0 to 63, and 
higher scores show more severe depression. A score less 
than 13 show no depression, between 14 and 19 show 
mild depression, 20 until 28 display moderate anxiety, 
and higher than 29 show severe depression. The 
concurrent validity of the original version of BDI was 
0.79 and its test-retest reliability has been reported to be 
0.67. Beck et al also reported its internal consistency by 
0.86 and the Cronbach’s α for patients and healthy 
participants as 0.86 and 0.71, respectively (32). Its 
psychometric properties have also been evaluated with 
an Iranian sample in which Cronbach’s α was 0.87 and 
its test-retest reliability was 0.49 (33). BDI demonstrated 
good reliability in this study (α = 0.90).  
 
Secondary Outcome Measure 
Cancer-Related Fatigue Scale (CFS)  
This 15-item scale consisted of 3 subscales: physical, 
affective, and cognitive. In this questionnaire, each item 
was presented on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very 
much). It also had a score ranging between 0 and 28 for 
the physical subscale, from 0 to 16 for the cognitive 
subscale, from 0 to 16 for the affective subscale, and 
between 0 and 60 for the total scale (34). Haghighat et al 
measured the reliability of the Persian version of this 
questionnaire using Cronbach’s α. Its reliability for 
physical, affective, and cognitive subscales and the 
overall fatigue was 0.92, 0.89, 0.85, and 0.95, 
respectively 
(35). 
The 
scale 
indicated 
desirable 
reliability in the current study (α = 0.87 for the physical, 
0.90 for affective, and 0.85 for cognitive subscales).  
Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-
SR)  
The WAI-SR is a 12-item measurement tool assessing 
therapeutic alliance between participants and a therapist. 
Its items were presented on a 5-point Likert-type scale 
from 1 (rarely/ never) to 5 (always). The Cronbach’s 
alpha coefficient for WAI-SR was reported to be 0.91. 
(36). Rahimian Boogar et al had measured the reliability 
of the Persian version of WAI-SR. In their study, 
Cronbach’s alpha was reported 0.92 and the test-retest 
reliability coefficient (3-month interval) was 0.74 (37).  
Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ)  
This questionnaire has 6 items that was derived from a 
45-item questionnaire and then administered before the 
second therapy session when treatment rationales were 
explained. The scale indicated high internal consistency 
with a standardized value from 0.79 to 0.90 (38). The 
Persian version of this scale includes 6-items and has 
been used in various studies. This scale showed good 
reliability in this study (α = 0.82).  
 
Protocols 
The MBCT group-based therapy plan was adapted 
according to the provided instructions by Segal et al (39) 
and the CBT protocol was adapted from instructions by 
Judith Beck (40). MBCT and CBT were also matched in 
terms of the number of sessions. The content of MBCT 
and CBT sessions is presented in Table 1. 
 
Procedure 
The participants were placed in 3 groups (CBT, MBCT, 
and WLG) and completed the questionnaires. The 
intervention groups received 8 weekly 90-minute 
sessions of CBT or MBCT. The sessions were held in a 
room of Ghaem hospital. It should be noted that 
following the implementation of the exclusion criteria, 1 
patient in the MBCT group passed away and 1 patient 
from CBT group quit the therapy because of familial 
problems. In the end, participants answered the 
questionnaires again. Recruitment of the participants in 
the study started in November 2018 and ended in 
January 2019. Participants were assigned to study groups 
by a person blinded to the study procedures. When the 
CBT sessions were finished, MBCT sessions were held. 
The participants in the 3 groups had no relationship with 
each other between the sessions. The evaluators and 
analysts 
were 
also 
blinded 
to 
the 
randomized 
assignments . 
 
Therapists and Treatments 
MBCT and CBT were run by an expert in clinical 
psychology with 3 years of supervised training in 
psychological treatments and 1 year in CBT and MBCT. 
Moreover, treatment adherence was monitored by a 
supervisor and 2 clinical psychologists with PhD degrees 
who were certified in CBT or MBCT. 
 
Control Conditions 
The WLG as the control group in this study received no 
psychological treatments, but all participants received 
their usual pharmacological treatments. After post 
assessment, the WLG participants were offered free 
treatments and were able to choose either MBCT or 
CBT. 
 
Data Analysis 
Data analysis was done by SPSS-16. Mean, standard 
deviation, and frequency were reported as descriptive 
statistics. Chi-square and independent t test were used 
for examining the differences between groups in 
demographic characteristics, and ANCOVA was used to 
determine the differences between groups in the posttest 
by controlling the pretest score. P &lt; 0.05 was assumed as 
a statistically significant value. The difference between 
the 2 means divided by a standard deviation for the data 
was consequently utilized for calculating the effect size 
(Cohen’s d).</paragraph></page><page number="5"><paragraph>Efficacy of MBCT and CBT in Cancer Patients

Results 
 
Demographic Characteristics 
The participants’ mean age was 47.77 years, and most of 
them (53.4%) aged 31 to 40 years. The results of the F-
test (F = 1.50, sig = 0.23) indicated no significant 
difference among the 3 study groups in age. Moreover, 
the chi-square results showed no significant difference 
among the 3 groups in term of the levels of education 
(Chi-square = 5.83; P = 0.66) and gender (chi-square = 
5.08; P = 0.08). In terms of marital status, most of 
participants were married (86.2%) 10.3% single, 1.7% 
widowed, and 1.7% divorced. Also, 79% were 
housewives and the rest were employed. The results of 
chi-square test of marital status (χ2= 11.17 and sig = 
0.083) and employment status (chi-square test = 12.40 
and sig = 0.13) showed no significant difference 
between the 3 groups regarding the type of marital status</paragraph></page><page number="6"><paragraph>Sheikhzadeh, Zanjani, Baari

and 
employment. 
Participants’ 
demographic 
characteristics are presented in Table 2. 
As shown in Table 3, a total of 67.2% of the participants 
had breast cancer, of whom 8.6% had colon cancer and 
24.1% had lymphoma cancer. In addition, chemotherapy 
was the most commonly used treatment for the 
participants (52.6% patients on MBCT and CBT and 
40% patients on WLG). No significant difference was 
not seen among the 3 groups on the cancer type (χ2 = 
3.68; P = 0.45) and common treatment type (χ2 = 15.02; 
P = 0.37). Among all participants, 41.4% had metastasis 
(CBT = 7; MBCT = 8; and WLG = 9). All participants 
had moderate depression and anxiety according to the 
cutoff BDI and BAI. Also, there was no significant 
difference among the 3 groups in term of depression, 
anxiety, and fatigue at baseline (P &gt;0.05).  
 
Therapeutic Alliance and Treatment Credibility 
Comparison of the results of CEQ between MBCT 
(mean = 34.84; SD = 12.09) and CBT (mean = 38.94; 
SD = 13.85) showed no significant difference between 
both groups regarding credibility (t = -0.97; sig = 0.33). 
The comparison of the results of WAI-SR also indicated 
no significant difference (P = 0.36; t = -0.91) between 
MBCT (mean = 47.57; SD = 2.16) and CBT (mean = 
48.10; SD = 1.24) groups in terms of the working 
alliance. 
 
Treatment Outcomes 
 
Primary Outcomes 
Depression 
The ANCOVA results of depression scores showed a 
significant difference between groups (F = 3.39; P &lt; 
0.05, Table 4). Also, the findings of the post hoc 
analyses demonstrated no significant difference (P = 
0.84) between MBCT and CBT groups in depression at 
the postintervention stage; however, CBT and MBCT 
groups had significant difference with WLG in 
depression scores at the postintervention stage (Table 5). 
Moreover, 
within-group 
comparisons 
showed 
a 
significant decrease from pretest to posttest for CBT (t = 
8.17; P &lt; 0.001; d = 1.83) and MBCT groups (t = 5.62; P 
&lt; 0.001; d = 1.50). No significant differences were 
found for WLG from preintervention to postintervention 
stage (t = -1.64; P = 0.11; d = -0.16).  
Anxiety 
It is found generally a significant difference between 
groups in anxiety at posttest (F = 16.74; P &lt; 0.001). 
Nonetheless, between-group comparisons also indicated 
no significant difference between MBCT and CBT 
groups at postintervention (P = 0.76). Nevertheless, the 
difference between both intervention groups and WLG 
was significant at postintervention (P &lt; 0.001; Table 5). 
Within-group comparisons also showed a significant 
decrease from before to after intervention for CBT (t = 
5.28; P &lt; 0.001; d = 2.53) and MBCT groups (t = 7.82; P 
&lt; 0.001; d = 2.13). No significant differences were 
observed 
for 
WLG 
from 
preintervention 
to 
postintervention (t = -1.03; P = 0.06; d = -0.17).  
 
Secondary Outcome 
Fatigue 
As presented in Table 4, the results revealed a significant 
effect for group (F = 8.69; P &lt; 0.05). The post hoc 
analyses demonstrated no significant difference between 
MBCT with CBT group (P = 0.84) and WLG (P = 0.10) 
at postintervention. However, the difference between 
CBT 
and 
WLG 
groups 
was 
significant 
at 
postintervention (P = 0.01). Moreover, within-group 
comparisons showed a significant decrease from pretest 
to posttest for CBT (t = 2.91; P &lt; 0.01; d = 1.12) and 
MBCT groups (t = 2.87; P = 0.01; d = 0.80). However, 
significant differences were not reported for WLG from 
preintervention to postintervention (t = 0.67; P = 0.50; d 
= 0.14).

Discussion 
The primary outcomes of this study were depression and 
anxiety. In this study, significant difference was not 
found between MBCT and CBT groups in the anxiety 
and 
depression 
at 
postintervention; 
however, 
a 
significant difference become found between CBT and 
MBCT groups with WLG. In other words, CBT and 
MBCT were equally effective in decreasing anxiety and 
depression of cancer patients. According to these results, 
the 2 treatments were not preferred over each other 
despite the fact that both of them were beneficial to 
cancer patients and could diminish their anxiety and 
depression. The present study was the first RCT to 
compare CBT and MBCT in cancer patients whose 
results were also consistent with previous investigations 
confirming the efficacy of MBCT for anxiety (41-43) 
and depression in cancer patients (14, 27, 44).  
As mentioned earlier, a significant difference was seen 
between the CBT group and WLG. This result was in 
agreement with previous investigations confirming the 
impact of CBT on anxiety (19, 45, and 46). The given 
results were also consistent with previous studies in 
terms of decreasing depression by CBT (45).  
In addition, the findings of the current study indicated no 
significant difference in fatigue (as secondary outcome) 
between patients in the MBCT group and WLG at 
posttest, which was inconsistent with previous studies 
such as Johns et al (47) and van der Lee et al (28) that 
reported the efficacy of MBCT in reducing fatigue of 
cancer patients. This inconsistency was probably due to 
differences in the duration of disease in participants of 
these studies, the number of therapy sessions, as well as 
the number of therapists. Also, given that MBCT 
involves a number of experimental techniques that 
require the visualization ability, it is possible that the 
participants in the present study were different in this 
ability from those in previous studies, so they needed to 
expend more energy. This might be assumed as another 
reason for the inefficacy of this treatment in fatigue . 
It is noteworthy to mention that mindfulness leads to 
acceptance of thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations 
without any judgments as well as a widespread 
awareness of them (48, 49). Individuals can also become 
aware of their ruminations over the past and the future 
through mindfulness-based practices. Using this insight, 
they gain control over their own thoughts, feelings, and 
sensations, and also become free from the automatic 
focus on the past and the future (49). Patients with 
cancer can consequently feel relaxed through meditation 
as a basic technique in MBCT. In addition, their 
depression 
may 
reduce 
using 
purposeful 
and 
nonjudgmental attention to the present moment (42).  
As Teasdale stated, human’s mind interprets events and 
experiences. It can also make severe and stable reactions 
and emotions. After experiencing stress and distress, 
physical symptoms can be amplified, which can increase 
distress and then keeps the defective cycle revolving 
(26). Thus, cognitive reappraisal and replacement 
thoughts techniques can be used for breaking the given 
cycle. In this respect, CBT techniques aid in changing 
individuals’ interpretations of distressing and stressful 
events and speeding up the treatment process. Relaxation 
techniques also pave the grounds for cognitive 
treatments via creating a relaxing mode for the body 
(reducing physical symptoms of distress). Therefore, 
their simultaneous use enhances their efficacy (50).  
According to the secondary outcome of the present 
study, CBT was beneficial in terms of reducing fatigue 
in cancer patients. This result was consistent with 
previous studies such as Matthews et al (51) and Eichler 
et al (19). Cancer patients catastrophize and magnify 
their fatigue. Consequently, they deprive themselves of 
many activities. By cognitive reappraisal technique, 
patients are reminded that a part of their fatigue has 
resulted from their cognitive distortion (52). Also, 
behavioral techniques of CBT may help cancer patients 
to be more active and decrease psychological fatigue.  
 
Limitation 
This study had some limitations. The sample size was 
small. The participants had been distributed based on 
their cancer types, there was no follow-up measurement, 
and also a self-report scale was used. These factors could 
limit the generalizability of the findings. Despite taking 
possible methods to control the variables, it was always 
difficult to take control of any variables in dealing with 
human subjects and psychological treatments. Therefore, 
the results should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, 
it is suggested to compare group and individual training 
in future studies. In addition, as patients’ families are 
also affected by diseases and their consequences, it 
seems that engaging family members in treatment 
sessions will produce more desired results. Thus, this 
issue should be taken into consideration in future 
research. Using more comprehensive measurement 
methods, such as observations and interviews, is 
suggested. Also, it is suggested that a similar study be 
conducted by a large sample size and a follow-up stage. 
Moreover, it is suggested that the efficacy of both 
treatments be compared in different cancer types. 
 
Conclusion 
The present study indicated that CBT and MBCT 
performed equally well in decreasing anxiety and 
depression in cancer patients. They were significantly 
better than the WLG, but CBT was preferable to MBCT 
in terms of fatigue treatment. It seemed that MBCT was 
a good alternative to CBT for decreasing emotional 
symptoms in cancer patients. Despite the fact that each 
treatment used its specific methods and techniques to 
accomplish its objective, both therapies had similar 
efficacy on depression and anxiety. Therefore, both of 
them can be used as complementary treatments along 
with pharmacological treatments for cancer patients.</paragraph></page><page number="9"><paragraph>Efficacy of MBCT and CBT in Cancer Patients
