Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efﬁcacy of a 4-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)
program on psychological distress in patients with lung cancer and elucidate its mechanisms.
Methods: This single-center, single-blinded, longitudinal, randomized controlled trial was conducted on 175 pa-
tients with lung cancer randomly allocated to a 4-week MBSR or a waiting-list group. The efﬁcacy and mecha-
nisms of the 4-week MBSR program were evaluated by outcome measures at preintervention (T0), the immediate
postintervention (T1), 1 month (T2), and 3 months (T3). We analyzed the collected data using the per-protocol set
principle, independent sample t-test, repeated measure analysis of variance, and structural equation modeling.
Results: The 4-week MBSR program signiﬁcantly alleviated psychological distress (F ¼ 15.05, P &lt; 0.001),
decreased perceived stigma (F ¼ 8.260, P ¼ 0.005), improved social support (F ¼ 16.465, P &lt; 0.001), and
enhanced mindfulness (F ¼ 17.207, P &lt; 0.001) compared with usual care at T1, T2, and T3. All variables
signiﬁcantly changed over time except for copying style (P ¼ 0.250). The changes in social support, mindfulness,
and perceived stigma mediated the efﬁcacy of the 4-week MBSR program on psychological distress (β ¼ �0.292,
P ¼ 0.005; β ¼ �0.358, P ¼ 0.005).
Conclusions: This study shows the beneﬁts of the MBSR program for psychological distress, social support,
mindfulness, and perceived stigma in patients with lung cancer. Also, it elucidates the mechanisms by which the
MBSR program alleviates psychological distress by improving social support, enhancing mindfulness, and
decreasing perceived stigma. The ﬁndings provide insights into applying the MBSR program to reduce psycho-
logical distress among patients with lung cancer.
Introduction
Lung cancer remains the ﬁrst reason of cancer-related death world-
wide, accounting for approximately 18% of all cancer deaths.1 In China,
according to the statistics published in 2022, lung cancer ranked ﬁrst in
incidence and cancer-related mortality, with new cases of 828,100 and
cancer-related deaths of 657,000.2 Patients with cancer will suffer from
various psychological problems except for various physical symptoms
(eg, fatigue and shortness of breath) due to cancer diagnosis and anti-
cancer treatment, especially psychological distress.3,4 Psychological
distress will exist throughout the cancer trajectory,5 having different
prevalence across studies, cancers, and countries,6 with a range from
20% to 58%.7–10 Compared with other cancers, lung cancer was
associated with the highest psychological distress prevalence,11,12 vary-
ing from 17.0% to 73.0%.13–15 In addition, a recent meta-analysis re-
ported a mean prevalence of 48.3% of psychological distress in Chinese
patients with lung cancer .16
Distress refers to “a multifactorial and unpleasant emotional experi-
ence, involving changes in psychological, social, spiritual, and physical
aspects,” according to the deﬁnition given out by the National

cologists prefer the term “distress” because it is less stigmatizing; there-
fore, the NCCN guideline panel used “distress” rather than “psychological
distress.”18 However, both terms are used interchangeably in the litera-
ture. Clinically signiﬁcant psychological distress is associated with a
range of adverse consequences,17 such as interruption of anticancer
treatment19–21, prolonged hospital stay,22 higher suicidal risk,23 poor
quality of life,14,24 and higher risk of mortality.25,26 Moreover, a previous
study also evidenced that psychological distress can accelerate the
growth of tumor cells.27 Therefore, regular and timely screening of
psychological distress among patients with cancer is critical because it
has been recognized as the sixth vital sign.17,28 Indeed,it is critical to
alleviate it after early and precise detection of psychological distress.
Currently, psychological interventions have been demonstrated efﬁ-
cacy in improving the psychological well-being of patients with can-
cer.29–31
Among
the
available
psychological
interventions,
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), initially developed by
Kabat-Zinn et al,32 has been widely applied in cancer settings31,33 and
might also the best psychological intervention to relieve cancer-related
fatigue.34 Based on previously published evidence,35–37 the practice of
mindfulness can guide participants purposefully pay attention to the
present moment and nonjudgmentally monitor the unfolding of experi-
ences moment by moment, thus having profound beneﬁt via the
mind–body connection. The standard MBSR program comprises an
8-week psychoeducational course and four meditative techniques,
including sitting meditation, body scan, gentle Hatha yoga, and walking
meditation.32,36,38 Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and
safety of MBSR program on psychosocial well-being and quality of
life.31,33,39,40 Currently, several studies have initially investigated the
role of MBSR program in patients diagnosed with lung diseases, such as
lung cancer41,42 and interstitial lung diseases.43,44 Furthermore, our
meta-analysis further demonstrated the positive impact of the MBSR
program on psychological states in patients with lung cancer.45 However,
a deﬁnitive conclusion regarding the efﬁcacy of the MBSR program for
psychological distress has not obtained and should be further investi-
gated in future studies with larger sample sizes.
Although a previous study attempted to explore the efﬁcacy of MBSR
program on psychological distress from three perspectives, including
mindfulness skills, self-compassion, and rumination,42 the exact psy-
chosocial mechanisms by which MBSR program alleviates psychological
distress remain unclear. Previous studies have revealed that several
psychosocial factors in patients with cancer are associated with psycho-
logical distress, such as social support,46 perceived stigma,47 perceived
stress,48 intrusive thoughts,49 symptom burden,49 type D personality,49
coping style,50 self-esteem,51 mindfulness,52,53 and illness percep-
tion.54,55 In addition, our previous studies explicitly investigated the
roles of social support, perceived stigma, perceived stress, coping styles,
self-esteem, mindfulness, and illness perception in the development of
psychological distress in patients with lung cancer.15,56–58 However, it
remains unclear which pathways may mediate the interventional effects
of the MBSR program on psychological distress in patients with lung
cancer.
Therefore, based on currently available evidence, we hypothesized
that (a) a 4-week MBSR program could alleviate psychological distress in
patients with lung cancer and (b) by affecting social support, coping
style, self-esteem, mindfulness, perceived stress, perceived stigma, and
illness perception.
Methods
Study design
The present study was a single-center, single-blinded, longitudinal,
randomized, controlled, parallel trial, including a 4-week MBSR program
group and a waiting-list group. We recruited eligible participants from a
hospital in southwest China between January 1 and September 30, 2021.
Data collection
We designed a face-to-face questionnaire survey to collect data,
administered by a trained research nurse at three time points (Fig. 1):
baseline (T0), the immediate postintervention (T1), 1 month post-
intervention (T2), and 3 months postintervention (T3).
Sample size
We estimated the sample size using psychological distress as the main
effect indicator for this study. According to our previous meta-analysis,45
the MBSR program was associated with an effect size of 0.418, which was
estimated based on the pooled result of psychological distress. Therefore,
we estimated a theoretical sample size of 75 cases to ensure a statistical
power of 80.0%. After considering a 20% dropout rate, 90 patients were
calculated and then randomized to the 4-week MBSR or the waiting-list
group. We used the G*Power software (version 3.1) to estimate the
sample size.
Participant criteria
We selected potential participants according to the following inclu-
sion criteria: (a) cytological or histological diagnosis of lung cancer; (b)
age �18 years; (c) patients with proven clinically signiﬁcant psycho-
logical distress or at high risk of suffering from psychological distress; (d)
known their diagnosis and were willing to participate in this study; and
(e) able to read, write, and speak Chinese.
Exclusion criteria included: (a) a concurrent diagnosis of other can-
cers or psychiatric disorders; (b) a history of suicide attempts; (c)
participation in any other psychosocial interventions within 3 months
before enrollment; (d) prior experience with mindfulness-based in-
terventions (MBIs); and (e) physical or cognitive (&lt; 26 on the Mini-
Mental State Examination) impairments hampering participation in the
4-week MBSR program or completion of questionnaires. Dropout criteria
included: (a) unable to complete the intervention and (b) loss to follow-
up.
Recruitment
The trained research nurses enrolled participants from the respiratory
and medical oncology inpatient departments of a general hospital in
southwest China at patient visits. Trained research nurses assessed their
eligibility, introduced the purpose of the study, and explained research
content to potential participants and ensured that participants volun-
tarily participated in this study.
Randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding
After signing a written informed consent, eligible participants
formally participated in this study. We ﬁrst conducted a baseline survey
of all participants in this study. Then, we randomly assigned participants
to a 4-week MBSR or waiting-list group using random numbers generated
by SPSS software (version 22.0). An independent research nurse used
sealed and opaque envelopes for assignments. We invited independent
psychologists qualiﬁed in the MBSR program to conduct a 4-week MBSR
program for participants in the experimental group. Since all participants
have been informed of the detailed processes of this study, it is not
possible to blind participants. However, outcome assessments were
blinded because independent staff analyzed all outcomes.
Interventions
Experimental group
Participants in the experimental group received both usual care and a
4-week MBSR program. In this study, we selected a 4-week MBSR pro-
gram as an intervention according to our meta-analysis45 because

time and fast deterioration in physical health.59 During this 4-week
MBSR program, all participants in the experimental group practiced
MBSR under the guidance and supervision of a psychologists qualiﬁed as
mindfulness trainer. The details of this 4-week program were as follows:
10-min explanation and meditation in the ﬁrst week, 10-min walking
meditation in the second week, 10-min breathing meditation in the third
week, and 20-min experience sharing in the fourth week. Details of each
session in this 4-week MBSR program are summarized in Table S1.
Participants were supervised to daily practice at home by psychologists
twice weekly using telephone or WeChat (a popular social media in
China).
Waiting-list group
Participants in the waiting list group ﬁrst received usual care,
including dietary instruction, health education, rehabilitation excise,
emotional
counseling,
and
medication
instruction.
Following
the
conclusion of this study, these participants were invited to voluntarily

materials for the intervention.
Demographics
At baseline, we used a self-designed data collection sheet to collect
the demographic and clinical characteristics, including demographic
information (gender, age, education level, occupation, marital status,
residence, medical insurance, yearly income, family history of lung
cancer, and smoking history) and clinical characteristics (TNM tumor
stage, metastases, comorbidities, and pain degree).
Outcome measures
Psychological distress
We used the distress thermometer (DT) to measure psychological
distress on an 11-point thermometer scale from 0 to 10 in this study,
and 0 and 10 indicate no distress and extreme distress, respectively.17
The reliability and validity of DT across different settings have been
extensively tested.60 Previous empirical studies indicated a score of � 4
effectively conﬁrms clinically signiﬁcant psychological distress.60,61 A
score of 4 was also demonstrated as the cut-off value for deﬁning
clinically signiﬁcant psychological distress in Chinese cancer pop-
ulations.60 Meanwhile, we used the predictive algorithm, which was
previously developed by our team,62 to identify those patients at high
risk of psychological distress. In this predictive algorithm, a score of �
66 indicates that patients have a high risk of suffering from psycho-
logical distress. We selected patients with lung cancer who scored
�4 in DT or � 66 in the predictive algorithm to participate in this
study.
Social support
The 12-item Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support was
used to measure social support from three aspects, including family,
friends, and signiﬁcant others, on a 7-point Likert scale (1 indicates very
strongly disagree but 7 represents very strongly agree).63 A previous
study tested the psychological properties of Multidimensional Scale of
Perceived Social Support and reported coefﬁcient alpha values of sub-
scales ranging from 0.81 to 0.98.63 The Chinese version had a reliability
of 0.90.64 We used the Chinese version in this study, which had an overall
Cronbach's alpha coefﬁcient of 0.818, 0.785, 0.835, and 0.701 at T0, T1,
T2, and T3, respectively, to measure social support.
Coping style
The 20-item Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire was used to eval-
uate the coping styles, including confrontation, avoidance, and giving up
coping, on a linear 4-point Likert scale from 1 to 3.65 Shen et al66 vali-
dated the Chinese version of the Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire,
reporting a Cronbach's alpha coefﬁcient of more than 0.60 for three
subscales. We used the Chinese version in this study, which had an
overall Cronbach's alpha of 0.561, 0.542, 0.753, and 0.537 at T0, T1, T2,
and T3, respectively, to measure coping style.
Self-esteem
The 10-item Rosenberg Self–Esteem Scale was developed to measure
global self-esteem, having a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88.67 A higher score
indicated a higher level of self-esteem.67 The Chinese version of the
Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale has been validated by Wu et al68 and has
been extensively used in China.69–71 We used the Chinese version in this
study, which had an overall Cronbach's alpha coefﬁcient of 0.809, 0.774,
0.750, and 0.775 at T0, T1, T2, and T3, respectively, to measure
self-esteem.
Mindfulness
The 39-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire was ﬁrst devel-
oped by Baer et al72 to assess mindfulness from ﬁve facets on a 5-point
Likert scale: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging,
and non-reacting.72 The original Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire
has been translated into Chinese73 with good psychometric properties. In
addition, a recent study continued to conﬁrm the psychometric proper-
ties of the Chinese version in patients with cancer using a Bayesian
structural equation modeling approach.74 We used the Chinese version in
this study, which had an overall Cronbach's alpha coefﬁcient of 0.644,
0.704, 0.731, and 0.749 at T0, T1, T2, and T3, respectively, to measure
mindfulness.
Perceived stress
The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure perceived
stress on a linear 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4.75 A higher score rep-
resents a greater stress level. The 10-item Chinese version has been
validated and got a Cronbach's alpha of 0.619.76 We used the Chinese
version in this study, which had an overall Cronbach's alpha coefﬁcient of
0.614, 0.608, 0.699, and 0.682 at T0, T1, T2, and T3, respectively, to
measure perceived stress.

The 31-item Cataldo lung cancer stigma scale was used to measure
perceived stigma, categorized into stigma and shame, social isolation,
discrimination, and smoking, on a linear 0- to 4-point.77 A higher score
indicates a higher level of perceived stigma. Yu et al78 translated the
original version to Chinese and reported an overall Cronbach’s alpha of
0.932. In addition, four subscales had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.799,
0.922, 0.863, and 0.803, respectively. This study used the Chinese

and 0.730 at T0, T1, T2, and T3, respectively, to measure perceived
stigma.
Illness perception
Weinman et al79 ﬁrst developed the Brief Illness Perception Ques-
tionnaire to measure illness's emotional and cognitive representations on
a continuous linear 0 to 10 point. A higher score represents a more
negative illness perception. Broadbent et al80 have shown a good
test–retest reliability and predictive and discriminant validity of the Brief
Illness Perception Questionnaire. Xue et al81 translated the original
version to Chinese, and it has been widely used in China.82,83 We used the
Chinese version in this study, which had an overall Cronbach's alpha
coefﬁcient of 0.657, 0.676, 0.643, and 0.630 at T0, T1, T2, and T3,
respectively, to measure illness perception.
Statistical analysis
We used descriptive statistics to present participants’ demographics.
The Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests showed that, in addition to age and risk
scores in the prediction algorithm, the distribution of scores for psy-
chological distress, social support, coping style, self-esteem, mindfulness,
perceived stress, perceived stigma, and illness perception was abnormal
at most time points. However, we preferred to use mean � standard
deviation (SD) for all continuous variables because (a) parametric tests
are more powerful than nonparametric tests, (b) the results of the Kol-
mogorov–Smirnov test are not necessarily true, especially for relatively
large sample size,84 and (c) according to kurtosis and skewness values,
our data followed a normal distribution.85 Therefore, we used the
Chi-square test and independent-sample t-test to compare the variables
between the two groups. However, repeated measure analysis of variance
was used to analyze changes or differences of variables between the
groups (experimental vs. waiting-list groups), within-group (time), and
interaction (group*time) effects.
Furthermore, we used structural equation modeling to elucidate the
mediating role of signiﬁcant variables that showed signiﬁcant differences
in the efﬁcacy of a 4-week MBSR program on psychological distress be-
tween the two groups after intervention We ﬁrst deﬁned the in-
terventions used in the experimental and waiting-list groups as dummy
variables using 1 (experimental group) and 0 (waiting-list group),

intervention using the baseline value.86
We employed IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)
version 22.0 and Amos version 21.0 for statistical analysis.
Ethical consideration
This study strictly followed the statement of the Declaration of Hel-
sinki. The ethical institutional board of the hospital approved this trial
(Approval No. CZLS2021183-A), and we also registered the study pro-
tocol
at
the
Chinese
Clinical
Trials
Registry
(Registration
No.
ChiCTR2100041899). Before participating in this study, all eligible
participants signed informed consent and were freely allowed to with-
draw from this study.
Results
Recruitment
As depicted in the CONSORT ﬂowchart (Fig. 1), 299 patients with
lung cancer were eligible for evaluation, but 190 patients who were
eligible agreed to participate in this study. Of the 190 patients, 95 were
randomly assigned to the experimental or waiting-list groups. However,
12 and 3 patients received no interventions in the experimental and
waiting-list groups, respectively. One hundred seventy-ﬁve patients
completed the study and underwent T1 and T2 assessments; however, at
the T3 assessment, 5 and 3 patients were missed from the experimental
and waiting-list groups, respectively. There was no statistically signiﬁ-
cant difference in the lost participants between the two groups at T3 (P ¼
0.480).
Participants’ characteristics
The mean age of the participants in the experimental and waiting-list
groups was 58.98 (SD ¼ 9.72) and 59.90 (SD ¼ 8.72), respectively,
without signiﬁcant difference (P ¼ 0.507). Of the 175 patients analyzed,
most patients were male (61.7%) and lived in the urban areas (58.9%).
Most patients were married (97.1%) and had low education (85.7% with
a middle–high school education or less). Most of the patients paid med-
ical costs using resident basic health insurance (97.7%) and had no
family history of lung cancer (96.0%). Still, most patients were pain free
(68.0%), had no comorbidity (76.6%), and were at stage III or IV. There
remaining demographic and clinical data of the two groups were no
signiﬁcantly different (P &gt; 0.05), as presented in Table 1.
The effect of the intervention on outcomes
The scores of seven variables between the two groups were not
signiﬁcantly different (P &gt; 0.05) at the baseline except for the score in
the mindfulness, which was signiﬁcantly higher in patients in the
waiting-list group than patients in the 4-week MBSR program group (t ¼
4.746, P &lt; 0.001). After the intervention, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, apart
from the coping style (F ¼ 1.386, P ¼ 0.250), the remaining variables
changed signiﬁcantly over time (P &lt; 0.05). As presented in Table 2, the 4-

Results of the mediating analysis
We only included three variables in the mediation analysis, including
social support, mindfulness, and perceived stigma, according to prede-
signed criteria. After structural equation modeling and appropriate
adjustment of the pathways between variables according to the modiﬁ-
cation index and empirical evidence, the model ﬁtted our data better (χ2/
df ¼ 3.451, CFI ¼ 0.893, TLI ¼ 0.855, RMSEA ¼ 0.122 [95% CI:

Overall, the effects of the 4-week MBSR program on psychological
distress at T1, T2, and T3 were �0.274, �0.292, and �0.358, respec-
tively. At the immediate postintervention (T1), the 4-week MBSR pro-
gram alleviated psychological distress directly (β ¼ �0.274, P ¼ 0.005),
not mediated by other variables. The effect of the 4-week MBSR program
on mindfulness at T1 and T2 continued to help alleviate psychological
distress at T2 (β ¼ �0.049). The effects of the 4-week MBSR program on
social support and mindfulness at T1 and T2 also continued to alleviate
psychological distress at T3 by reducing perceived stigma at T2 and T3 (β
¼ �0.039). The effect of the 4-week MBSR program on perceived stigma
at T1, T2, and T3 also inﬂuenced psychological distress at T3 (β ¼
�0.081). Moreover, there was a continuous effect between psychological
distress from T1 to T3 (β ¼ 0.886 from T1 to T2, β ¼ 0.816 from T2 to T3),
indicating that the 4-week MBSR program had a persistent effect on
psychological distress (β ¼ �0.198). The results of mediation analysis are
summarized in Table 3, and the mechanism pathways are depicted in
Fig. 4.
Discussion
In this study, we aimed to validate the interventional effects of a 4-
week MBSR program on psychological distress in patients with lung
cancer and to further elucidate the psychosocial mechanisms by which
the program alleviates psychological distress. Our ﬁndings suggest that
the 4-week MBSR program, as an effective psychological intervention,
signiﬁcantly alleviates the psychological distress. The 4-week MBSR
program also improved patients’ social support considerably, enhanced
mindfulness, and reduced perceived stigma. Furthermore, the results of
the structural equation modeling suggest that the 4-week MBSR program
can exert an interventional effect by directly targeting psychological
distress. Meanwhile, the 4-week MBSR program supports continuous
interventional effects on psychological distress by indirectly affecting
social support, mindfulness, and perceived stigma.
MBSR has been extensively used in cancer settings.31,33 Currently,
many meta-analyses30,31,40,87,88 have demonstrated the beneﬁts of MBSR
program in improving the psychological well-being of patients with
cancer. Furthermore, our recent meta-analysis conﬁrmed that the MBSR
program signiﬁcantly diluted negative psychological states and enhanced
positive psychological states. In this study, we further validated the
beneﬁcial role of the MBSR program in alleviating psychological distress
in patients with lung cancer. Although it remains not entirely unclear
why and how the MBSR program improves psychological well-being,
previous studies35–37 suggest that the practice of mindfulness instructs
participants to deliberately focus on the present moment and monitor the
unfolding of experiences all the time without passing judgment. As a
result, participants experience profound beneﬁts through the mind-body
connection. Thus, it is plausible that patients with lung cancer experience
signiﬁcant alleviation in psychological distress, improvement in social
support, enhancement in mindfulness, and reduction in perceived stigma
following a 4-week MBSR program.
This study also showed that the MBSR program had a retained effect
on psychological distress after ending the intervention through indirect

mindfulness89 and social support90 are positive sources for copying with
negative psychological states, and our previous studies have demon-
strated the inverse association between mindfulness and social support
and psychological distress.15,56,58 In contrast, stigma, a negative
emotional experience that includes isolation, rejection, degradation, and
criticism due to undesirable conditions,77 has been demonstrated to be a
predictor of psychological distress in patients with lung cancer.47 In
general, psychosomatic balance plays a vital role in regulating the psy-
chological well-being of patients with cancer.91 Therefore, patients
would suffer from signiﬁcant physical and psychological problems when
speciﬁc
events
(eg,
cancer
diagnosis)
destroyed
psychosomatic
balance.87
According to the Mindful Coping Model,92 we can easily explain why
MBSR program can consistently affect psychological distress through
social support, mindfulness, and perceived stigma. Speciﬁcally, the
destructive effects of internal and external stressors (eg, cancer diagnosis,
anticancer treatment, and symptom burden) can cause psychological
distress in patients; however, the implementation of an MBSR program
can initiate psychological adjustment to trigger or enhance the protective
effects of positive sources (improvement in social support and enhance-
ment in mindfulness) and weaken the harmful effects of negative sources
(reduction in perceived stigma)93 and may then signiﬁcantly dilute the
destructive impacts of stressors (alleviation in psychological distress).94
Strengths and limitations
Overall, our study obtained these valuable ﬁndings due to several
strengths. First, we enrolled both patients with clinically signiﬁcant
psychological distress and those at high risk of psychological distress by
applying both DT and the risk prediction algorithm we developed, which
signiﬁcantly expanded the applicability of our ﬁndings in clinical prac-
tice. Second, we estimated the theoretical sample size from our meta-
analysis, which ensured the statistical power of our results. Third, we
explored the intervention mechanisms of the 4-week MBSR program by
determining the role of signiﬁcant variables after the intervention, which
beneﬁted more simply revealing the active ingredients of the 4-week
MBSR program. Fourth, all potential mediating variables included in
the intervention mechanism analysis have been previously investigated
for their role in the development of psychological distress, increasing the
reliability of theoretical evidence. Finally, our study was also rated as
high in methodological quality because it met the six Cochrane collab-
oration criteria for high-quality trials,95 except that blinding participants
due to the nature of the psychological intervention.
We cannot deny the fact that our study has several limitations. First
and foremost, we used self-reported instruments to collect data, which
may affect the accuracy of the results. Therefore, more objective tools
need to be developed to measure these variables. Second, we recruited
potentially eligible participants from only one hospital in southwest
China due to the limited time. Therefore, we are unable to eliminate the
adverse impact of selection bias and time constraints on our ﬁndings. As a
result, adequately powered studies with more extended intervention and
follow-up duration are warranted to demonstrate our ﬁndings. Third, we
selected only those variables tested in our previous studies to explore
possible mechanisms of the MBSR program on psychological distress.
However, we did not consider those factors that we did not investigate
previously. Therefore, more intervention mechanism analysis is needed
to fully reveal the nature of MBSR program in alleviating psychological
distress in patients with lung cancer. Fourth, we used a 4-week MBSR
program with abbreviated sessions instead of a standard 8-week MBSR
program in this study, which may have underestimated the intervention
effect of the MBSR program due to inadequate duration of intervention.
Therefore, future studies should further balance the interventional effects
and applicability of the MBSR program in patients with lung cancer.
More importantly, it is necessary to further investigate the interventional
effects of the enhanced protocol with adequate sessions in future studies.
Fifth, the mechanism model ﬁtted our data relatively when we explored
the intervention mechanism of the MBSR program to alleviate psycho-
logical distress, which limited the generalization of our results. There-
fore, considering that limited participants were enrolled in our study, we

intervention mechanism of the MBSR program in alleviating psycholog-
ical distress. Sixth, we chose brief versions of the scales to ensure the
quality of the data collection process in this study; however, the average
time for a patient to complete all scales was still up to 45 min. Although
no patients were excluded for failing to complete scales, we could not
eliminate the psychological burden caused by the need to complete
multiple scales. Finally, in this study, we did not consider the impacts of
sleep, fatigue, and exercise on the psychological status of patients with
lung cancer. Therefore, we suggest future studies to address this
limitation.
Conclusions
In summary, the present study validated the intervention effect of the
MBSR program in alleviating psychological distress, and provided rela-
tively robust and reliable evidence for clinical practitioners to integrate
the MBSR program into usual care to improve psychological well-being of
patients with lung cancer. Meanwhile, this study also suggested the
positive effects of MBSR program on social support, mindfulness, and
perceived stigma, which provided a reference for the application of
MBSR program to improve clinical outcomes. Furthermore, this study
revealed the direct impact of the MBSR program on short-term psycho-
logical distress. Additionally, it indicated the continuous effect of the
MBSR program on psychological distress through social support, mind-
fulness, and perceived stigma.
