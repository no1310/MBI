Abstract
Context. Mindfulness-based interventions have been receiving growing attention in cancer care.
Objectives. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive
therapy (MBCT) for psychological distress (anxiety and depression), fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), fatigue, spiritual well-
being, and quality of life (QOL) in Japanese ambulatory patients with Stage IeIII breast cancer.
Methods. A total of 74 patients were randomly assigned to either an eight-week MBCT intervention group (n ¼ 38) or a
wait-list control group (n ¼ 36). The primary outcome was psychological distress, measured on Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale. The secondary outcomes were FCR (Concerns About Recurrence Scaledoverall anxiety subscale), fatigue
(Brief Fatigue Inventory), spiritual well-being (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness TherapydSpiritual), QOL
(Functional Assessment of Cancer TherapydGeneral), and mindfulness skills (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire). The
participants were assessed at baseline (T0), Week 8 (T1), and Week 12 (T2). The results were analyzed using a intention-to-
treat linear mixed model.
Results. The participants in the MBCT group experienced signiﬁcantly better outcomes in their psychological distress
(Cohen’s d ¼ 1.17; P &lt; 0.001), FCR (d ¼ 0.43; P &lt; 0.05), fatigue (d ¼ 0.66; P &lt; 0.01), spiritual well-being (d ¼ 0.98; P &lt; 0.001),
and QOL (d ¼ 0.79; P &lt; 0.001) compared with the control group. The difference remained signiﬁcant at T2 (four weeks after
completion of the intervention).
Conclusion. MBCT was demonstrated to improve well-being that encompasses psychological, physical, and spiritual
domains in Japanese patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer. The favorable effect was maintained up to four weeks after the
completion of the intervention.

This article describes a randomized controlled trial
that demonstrated the effectiveness of mindfulness-
based cognitive therapy for psychological distress
(anxiety and depression), fear of cancer recurrence,
fatigue, spiritual well-being, and quality of life in Japa-
nese ambulatory patients with Stage IeIII breast
cancer.
Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common kind of cancer
among women.1 Patients experience a variety of phys-
ical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems related to
the illness and its treatment. Clinically signiﬁcant psy-
chological distress is experienced by up to 50% of
patients with breast cancer.2,3 Even for patients with
a good prognosis or for patients who have completed
cancer treatment, potential risk of cancer progression
and relapse continues to cause long-term distress to
patients and survivors, known as the fear of cancer
recurrence (FCR).4,5 Furthermore, physical symptoms
such as fatigue and pain impair their social func-
tioning and quality of life (QOL).6,7 In fact, FCR
and fatigue are the two most common symptoms
that cancer survivors experience after completion of
cancer treatment.4e6,8
Mindfulness-based approaches have been recently
establishing
strong
evidence
in
cancer
care.9
Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) guide pa-
tients to focus on the present moment, foster their
awareness,
and
cultivate
compassionate
attitudes
through meditation, yoga, group discussion, and daily
contemplative practices. These processes lead to bet-
ter control in their emotion, cognition, and behavior,
and ultimately to the stability of the mind.9,10 The
most commonly used MBIs are mindfulness-based
stress
reduction
(MBSR)
and
mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy (MBCT). Although there is no
substantial difference in the structure of these two
programs; MBCT incorporates a cognitive therapy
approach and provides more explicit psychoeducation
on the relationship among mood, cognition, and
functioning compared with MBSR.11
A series of systematic reviews demonstrate that
MBIs are effective to alleviate psychological distress
of patients with cancer.12e16 However, the effective-
ness of MBIs for physical symptoms has been contro-
versial. Although a few studies have shown beneﬁcial
effects of MBIs for fatigue and pain,17e20 the results
have been inconsistent.21,22 Furthermore, research
for patients with breast cancer so far has been largely
focused on MBSR, and there have been only a few
randomized
controlled
trials
of
MBCT
in
this
context.12,14,15 Of those MBCT trials, there has been
only one study that speciﬁcally targeted patients
with breast cancer.19 This study demonstrated the
efﬁcacy of MBCT on pain and QOL but failed to
demonstrate a signiﬁcant effect on anxiety, depres-
sion, or well-being. Thus, to date, the effectiveness
of MBCT for patients with breast cancer has not
been conﬁrmed.
In contrast, in our previous observational study, we
demonstrated that MBCT yielded signiﬁcant improve-
ment in psychological distress, spiritual well-being,
and QOL in a sample of Japanese patients with breast
cancer.23
For these reasons, the present study aimed to
examine the effectiveness of MBCT for psychological
distress (anxiety and depression) of patients with
breast cancer in randomized controlled design. Also,
we aimed to examine whether MBCT alleviates other
important clinical issues, such as FCR, fatigue, spiri-
tual well-being, and QOL. The authors hypothesized
that MBCT is effective for these outcomes.
Methods
Design
This was a randomized controlled trial comparing
an
MBCT
intervention
and
the
wait-list
control
(WLC) in ambulatory nonmetastatic breast cancer
patients.
Participants
The eligibility criteria were the following: 1) clinical
diagnosis of Stage 0eIII breast cancer, 2) aged be-
tween 20 and 74 years, 3) the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS) total score of ﬁve or higher,
4) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status of 0e2, 5) expected clinical prognosis of one
year or longer, 6) ability to communicate in Japanese,
and 7) submission of written informed consent. Pa-
tients were excluded if they had the experience of
MBCT or MBSR, or if they had any serious physical
or
psychiatric
symptoms
to
impede
with
study
participation.
Recruitment
The participants were recruited at Keio University
Hospital, a tertiary medical facility in central Tokyo,
Japan. The participants were recruited by self-referral
through ﬂyers or by referral from oncologists and
other medical staff during the period between January
2015 and August 2016. Potential participants were
invited to an introductory session, where they were ex-
plained about the details of the study and submitted
written informed consent.
Assessments
Assessments were conducted at three time pointsdat
baseline (before random allocation) (T0), at eight
382

Park et al.</paragraph></page><page number="3"><paragraph>weeks
(postintervention
for
the
intervention
group) (T1), and at 12 weeks (i.e., four weeks
after the completion of the intervention for the inter-
vention group) (T2).
Intervention
The intervention group received an eight-week
MBCT program (two hours per week) in a group
format (Table 1). The details of the program are
illustrated elsewhere.23 The program was based on
the original MBCT program,11 with minimal modiﬁ-
cation to ﬁt with the needs of patients with breast
cancer.23 Although the original MBCT program has
a daylong retreat session between the sixth and
seventh weeks, we deleted this session because it
was considered too burdensome for Japanese patients
with cancer to join a daylong program. We added
brief psychoeducation to the ﬁrst session regarding
the distress of patients with cancer and on how
MBIs can be helpful for it. Lectures and exercises
on compassion were provided. Other components
of the original MBCT program were kept unchanged.
The program consisted of formal meditational exer-
cises, psychoeducation based on cognitive therapy,
and discussion and interaction among the partici-
pants to facilitate their learning. Homework was
assigned to the participants at every session, which
was supposed to take 20e45 minutes every day. Par-
ticipants
were
provided
with
a
meditation-guide
compact disc. Each group consisted of four to nine
participants.
The therapists were clinical psychologists, psychia-
trists, and nurses who had ﬁve to seven years of mind-
fulness
experience
and
had
undergone
MBCT
training provided by the Oxford Mindfulness Center.
The therapists followed the intervention protocol
schedule at each session to ensure treatment integrity.
A research assistant directly observed the session and
checked for treatment adherence.
For the participants who were allocated to the
intervention group, there was no restriction on any
cointerventions during the study period.
Control
The participants who were allocated to the control
group received assessments only during the study
period. They were asked to refrain from participating
in any type of MBIs or from engaging in meditational
exercise (including yoga) during the study period.
They were invited to an MBCT program conducted
by the research team after the study period.
Measurements
Primary Outcome.
The primary outcome was psycho-
logical distress (anxiety and depression), measured by
the HADS.24 The HADS is a 14-item self-administered
questionnaire that measures the severity of anxiety
and depression by seven items each. Scores for each
subscale range from zero (no distress) to 21 (maximum
distress). Higher scores indicate a greater level of psy-
chological distress.

MBCT for Breast Cancer: RCT</paragraph></page><page number="4"><paragraph>Secondary Outcomes
Fear of cancer recurrence.
We used the Concerns About
Recurrence Scale (CARS) to evaluate the participants’
FCR.25 The CARS has been validated in measuring
FCR in patients with breast cancer. In the present
study, only the subscale of overall FCR (four items)
was used to lessen the burden of the participants to
administer. Higher scores indicate a greater level of
FCR.
Fatigue.
We used the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) to
evaluate the participants’ fatigue.26 The BFI is a vali-
dated measure that consists of 10 items. The higher
scores indicate more intense fatigue.
Spiritual Well-Being.
We used the Functional Assess-
ment of Chronic Illness TherapydSpiritual (FACIT-
Sp) to measure the participants’ spiritual well-being.27
The FACIT-Sp is a 12-item self-administered instru-
ment, which comprises two subscalesdthe sense of
meaning and faith.
Quality of Life.
We evaluated the participants’ QOL
using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Thera-
pydGeneral.28 This widely used questionnaire con-
sists of 27 items, with a higher score indicating
better
QOL.
The
questionnaire
comprises
four
domainsdphysical, social, emotional, and functional
well-being.
Mindfulness Skills.
We used the Five Facet Mindful-
ness Questionnaire to assess the participants’ mindful-
ness
skills.29
This
39-item
self-administered
questionnaire measures ﬁve domains of mindfulness
skillsdobserving, describing, acting with awareness,
nonjudging of inner experience, and nonreacting
with inner experience. This scale was used as a process
measure of the interventiondto measure whether the
participants have taken up mindfulness skills.
Adherence to the Intervention.
The participants’ adher-
ence to the intervention was evaluated using the atten-
dance of the program and homework. The patients
who attended less than four (of eight) sessions were
considered to be dropouts.
Sample Size and Randomization
The sample size of the study was calculated based on
the results of our pilot study.23 We assumed that the
HADS total score would decrease from 17.0 to 11.8,
with SD of 8.0 in the MBCT group, whereas the score
would remain unchanged in the control group. These
estimates were considered to satisfy the minimal clini-
cally important difference of the HADS.24 With 80%
power and alpha of 0.05, the required sample size
was calculated as 37 participants in each arm. We
estimated the dropout rate as 15%, resulting in 88 par-
ticipants in total.
The participants were randomly assigned to MBCT
or WLC at a ratio of 1:1. The randomization was
managed by an organization independent of the
research team (Keio University Clinical and Transla-
tional Research Center). Block randomization was
conducted by a computer-generated random number
list
using
an
electronic
software
(http://www.
randomization.com), stratiﬁed by the participants’
anxiety levels at baseline (10 $ vs. &lt;10 on the
HADS-anxiety subscale [HADS-A]).
Statistical Analysis
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the par-
ticipants were analyzed by t-test or Chi-squared test to
examine differences between the groups at baseline.
For minor missing values (&lt;20% of a scale), we
imputed them with mean scores of the scale. Primary
and secondary outcomes were analyzed by a repeated-
measures approach using a linear intention-to-treat
mixed-effects model. The model included interactions
of intercept, time, and time � group as ﬁxed effects.
The effect size was calculated using Cohen’s d statistics.
The effect sizes were considered large when d ¼ 0.8 or
higher, d ¼ 0.5e0.8 as medium, and d ¼ 0.2e0.5 as
low. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS,
Version 25 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL).
Results
Participants
Of the 108 potential participants, 34 patients were
excluded (six ineligible, four declined, and 24 not
shown up for the introductory session), resulting in
74
participants
who
submitted
written
informed
consent. Because the dropout rate was lower than
expected (7.9%), we aborted recruitment before
reaching the target sample size. These 74 participants
were randomized to either the MBCT group (n ¼ 38)
or the control group (n ¼ 36) (Consolidated Stan-
dards of Reporting Trials diagram: Fig. 1).
The participants’ mean age was 53.7 years, ranging
from 38 to 70. Patients with Stage I and II breast can-
cer comprise the majority. The mean length of time
since cancer diagnosis was approximately three years.
There was no signiﬁcant difference in the demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of the participants
between the intervention group and the control group
(Table 2).
Intervention Adherence
Three of 38 patients in the MBCT group attended
less than four sessions and considered as dropouts
384

Park et al.</paragraph></page><page number="5"><paragraph>(dropout rate 7.9%). The reasons for not attending
were health problems, work circumstances, and family
issues. The mean number of attended sessions was
6.76. The mean time spent on homework was 24.2 mi-
nutes per day (SD 14.6).
Primary Outcome
The MBCT group experienced signiﬁcantly greater
improvement at the eighth week in their psychological
distress (both in anxiety and depression), compared
with the control group (the mean difference in the

Questionnaire
showed
a

MBCT for Breast Cancer: RCT</paragraph></page><page number="6"><paragraph>Discussion
The present study demonstrated that our MBCT
intervention
signiﬁcantly
reduced
psychological
distress (both anxiety and depression) in patients
with nonmetastatic breast cancer. Also, MBCT was
proven effective for increasing spiritual well-being
and QOL and reducing the FCR and fatigue. The ef-
fect was maintained at four weeks after the completion
of the treatment. To the best of authors’ knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst study in Japan that demonstrated the
effectiveness of MBCT in patients with cancer.
The HADS total score decreased from 16.13 to 6.18
after the MBCT intervention. Although there has been
a variation in proposed cutoff scores for the HADS,
patients with cancer with a HADS total score of 13
or more are considered to require psycho-oncologic
support.30 In a sample of Japanese patients with can-
cer, a cutoff score of 11 or higher corresponds to
adjustment disorder.31 In the present study, MBCT
contributed to alleviating the participants’ psycholog-
ical distress from a clinical level to a subclinical level.
This drastic improvement in psychological distress
agrees with the ﬁndings of the past MBCT study that
had been conducted in a mixed cancer population.32
Alleviation of FCR by MBCT is noteworthy. FCR is
one of the commonest problems of cancer survivors.
It has been known that FCR will not resolve spontane-
ously even long after cancer remission, thus speciﬁc
intervention is needed for cancer survivors who suffer
from clinically signiﬁcant FCR.4 It is reasonable that
MBCT is effective for alleviating FCR because MBCT
considers rumination as a key focus of intervention,
and rumination is one of the key psychological mech-
anisms
of
FCR.33
So
far,
a
few
psychological
approaches
have
been
developed
to
address
FCR.34e36 They are all relatively new and were specif-
ically developed for FCR. MBCT may have an advan-
tage over such interventions in that it is not only
effective for FCR but also covers a broad spectrum of
symptom burden.
Also, it is noteworthy that MBCT relieved patients’
fatigue. Fatigue is one of the two commonest symp-
toms of cancer survivors, which signiﬁcantly impairs
the QOL of patients with cancer. Effective pharmaco-
therapy has not been established. Although physical
exercise and sleep management have been proven
effective, their effect sizes are not intense.8 Further-
more, it is often not easy for clinicians to lead fatigued
cancer survivors to physical exercise.
Furthermore, our MBCT intervention substantially
improved patients’ QOL and spiritual well-being. It
is of note that MBCT not only alleviated negative psy-
chological aspects of patients with cancer but also
increased positive aspects of their daily lives. Spiritual
well-being serves to buffer clinically important issues,
such as pain, fatigue, depression, and wish of hastened
death.37 Mindfulness, which cultivates a sense of
wholeness and internal unity, may have the potential
to
elucidate
self-insight
of
patients
with
cancer
regarding the meaning of life despite the presence
of a life-threatening illness.
A recent meta-analysis on the effectiveness of MBIs
for patients with cancer and survivors demonstrated
that larger effects were observed in studies adhering
to the original MBI manuals, with younger patients,
with passive control conditions, and with shorter
time
to
follow-up.16
Our
study
ﬁts
with
these
characteristics.
The strength of the present study includes a robust
randomized controlled trial design and the low attri-
tion rate. This attrition rate is substantially low
compared with the past MBIs. A recent meta-analysis
showed that the median attrition rate of MBIs in anx-
iety disorder and depressive disorders was 15.5%.38
Our MBCT program, which was tailored to ﬁt the
needs of patients with breast cancer, seems to have
been well accepted by Japanese patients with breast
cancer.
Study Limitations
The present study has some limitations. First, the
study sample was relatively small and was limited to
ambulatory nonmetastatic breast cancer patients in a
single facility. Second, using of a WLC instead of an
active control weakens the robustness of the study.
The effectiveness of our intervention may partly derive
from nonspeciﬁc effect of group therapy.

because this is the ﬁrst study that demonstrated that
our MBCT program, which was speciﬁcally targeted
for patients with breast cancer, signiﬁcantly improved
a wide spectrum of symptoms encompassing psycho-
logical, physical, and spiritual domains. Also, this is
the ﬁrst study in Japan that demonstrated the effec-
tiveness of MBCT in patients with cancer. Given that
MBCT can improve wide range of symptoms (anxiety,
depression, FCR, fatigue, spiritual well-being, and
QOL), and given that the program can be delivered
to many patients at a time in a group format, it would
be a fascinating option for patients with breast cancer
who suffer from such symptoms.
Future research implications include examining
the long-term effects of the program because the pre-
sent study evaluated the participants only up to four
weeks after completion of the intervention. Another
research implication is dismantling the mechanism
of the intervention. The program may be shortened
if essential components of the program become
clearer. Because we observed that MBCT was effective
for
multiple
symptoms,
disentangling
the
inter-
relations between each variable and elucidating the
focus of MBCT can contribute to a more efﬁcient
way to address symptoms of patients with cancer.
Exploring the biological effects of MBIs is another
orientation of research.39,40
Conclusions
To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
study that demonstrated that an MBCT program
that was speciﬁcally targeted for patients with breast
cancer signiﬁcantly improved a wide spectrum of

MBCT for Breast Cancer: RCT</paragraph></page><page number="8"><paragraph>spiritual domains. Also, this is the ﬁrst study in Japan
that demonstrated the effectiveness of MBCT for pa-
tients with cancer. Given that MBCT can be delivered
to many patients at a time in a group-therapy format,
it would be a fascinating option in clinical practice.
